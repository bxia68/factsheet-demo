ITEM 1 – EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Minxcon (Pty) Ltd (“Minxcon”) was commissioned by Desert Gold Ventures Inc. (“Desert Gold” or “the Client”) to compile an updated NI 43-101 technical report for the Farabantourou Gold Mining Permit area (also referred to as “Farabantourou”), in the Kéniéba District of Western Mali in the form of a Mineral Resource estimate for the “Barani East”, or “Barani East Prospect” portion of the Permit Area.
Item 1 (a) – PROPERTY DESCRIPTION
As shown in the following figure, the Farabantourou permit area is located in southwest Mali, west of the town of Diafara, near the Senegal-Mali border. The Barani East Prospect is situated in the northern part of the Farabantourou permit area.

Item 1 (b) – OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY
Desert Gold acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of TransAfrika Belgique SA (“TransAfrika”) in 2011. This resulted in Desert Gold acquiring a 74% holding in all of the previous TransAfrika projects in Mali, including the Farabantourou permit. The remaining shares are held equally by the joint venture partners Rock SARL and International Business Holdings Limited (“IBHL”). The shareholding of the Farabantourou permit is as follows:-
 74% to Desert Gold;  13% to International Business Holdings Limited; and  13% to Rock SARL.
Officially, the permit has been recorded as being the Farabantourou permit, PR 08/3549, Arrete N° 20122401/MCMI-RD DU 14 AOU 2012. The permit covers an area of 112 km2. This was delivered in November

2008, renewed in November 2011 and required renewal on 17th November 2014. Subsequent to this, the permit has been renewed again for a further two years from 18th November 2014.

Item 1 (c) - GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSIT
The area along the Senegal-Mali border is underlain by Proterozoic and Archaean rocks of the West Africa craton. The craton stabilized at approximately 1800Ma and is composed of the Reguibat shield to the north and the Leo or Man shield to the south. The Leo shield is built on an Archaean nucleus with the Baoul-Mossi (Proterozoic) domain forming the majority of the shield in the southwest, (Kusnir, 1999). The Baoul-Mossi domain contains inliers of Archaean rocks and Birimian formations which were deposited between 2300Ma and 1900Ma i.e. Lower to Middle Proterozoic. These Birimian rocks were affected by the Eburnean orogeny which was most active from 2000Ma to 1800Ma, peaking at approximately 1950Ma.

Item 1 (d) - OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT GEOLOGY
One of these Archaean inliers is the Kéniéba Inlier, a north-northwest trending granite-greenstone belt which occurs along the Mali-Senegal border. The Kéniéba Inlier is comprised of Birimian volcano-sedimentary formations regionally metamorphosed to greenschist facies and intruded by large granitoid-gneiss complexes, (Hyde, 2001).

In the Kéniéba region most of the gold deposits are contained within secondary structures and splay faults associated with the Senegal-Mali Fault Zone (“SMFZ”) (see the following figure), often where southeast to northwest sutures cross-cut the dominant structural fabric. These zones are defined by hydrothermally introduced mineralisation within dilation zones; the gold deposits are hosted by penetrative shears and not by a single structural feature. This implies that the whole region has great potential for the discovery of additional gold deposits (Hyde, 2001). Several well-known gold deposits occur within the Kéniéba Inlier. These include Sadiola, Yatela, Tabakoto and Segala, Loulo and Sabodala. The locations of these deposits are shown in the second figure in this section, which depicts the regional geology of the Kéniéba Inlier.

The gold mineralisation is mesothermal in origin and occurs as free gold in quartz vein stock works and zones of silicification. It is often associated with arsenopyrite and to a lesser extent, pyrite and antimony.
Item 1 (e) - LOCAL PROPERTY GEOLOGY
The preliminary geological interpretation of the Farabantourou permit was made from the regional aeromagnetic data and regional geological maps. A north-northwest to south-southeast striking structural discontinuity forms the contact between the western sedimentary units and the eastern volcanosedimentary units. This feature has been interpreted to be part of the SMFZ. North-northeast striking dykes cut through parts of the permit. The siliciclastic sediments to the west of the SMFZ, consisting of sandstones, siltstones and conglomerates belong to the Kéniébandi Formation. The coarse-grained sandstones and conglomerates within this Formation have a significant volcanic content and appear to grade into rhyolitic pyroclastics and lavas to the west.
Item 1 (f) – STATUS OF EXPLORATION
Hyundai Mali S.A. (Hyundai) investigated the permit for gold as part of their Sepola Project (Hyde 2001, Hyundai Mali 2004). Hyundai held the permit from 1998 until 2004. Some of the data from the 1998-2001 drilling programmes are available in the public domain.
Between October 2001 and June 2002, 823 RC drillholes were drilled producing a total of 53,139 m of drillhole data. This drilling programme was a follow-up on targets identified by geochemical surveys, aeromagnetic surveys and artisanal workings. Mineralisation was discovered in six areas, namely Barani, Barani East, Keniegoulou, Dambamba, Kousilli and Linnguekoto (refer to the figure below). By June 2001, 63 drillholes (5,628 m) and 54 mineralised intersections were drilled on the Barani East Prospect. Mineralisation was tested over 1,200 m of strike.

Exploration undertaken by Desert Gold on the Farabantourou Permit was aimed at identifying drill targets. Exploration work undertaken by Desert Gold on Farabantourou comprised:-
 Interpretation of satellite imagery covering the area.  Regional soil sampling over the western part of the permit, with infill soil sampling. Samples were
taken on 100 m spaced lines and on a sample interval of 50 m. Sampling was completed in an eastwest and on a south-southwest to north-northeast grid.  A first phase of reverse circulation (“RC”) drilling of the gold anomalous zone, identified by Hyundai. In total, 10 additional drillholes were completed.  IP surveys, completed by Spectral Geophysics.
A series of IP surveys were completed by Spectral Geophysics in early January 2010 over the Kousilli target area. In addition, IP Surveys were also carried out on the Dambamba, Keniegoulou South, Keniegoulou and Barani (inclusive of Barani East) areas of the permit. The soil anomalies from the earlier sampling programme were shown to coincide with structures interpreted from the chargeability maps in 5 areas on the grid.
Ten RC drillholes were drilled (totalling 978 m) over one of the identified soil anomalies in the eastern part of the Kousilli area. Only two of the drillholes, FARC004 and FARC005, intersected any significant mineralisation. Drillhole FARC005 intersected 18 m @ 1.26g/t Au. This intersection includes 4 m @ 2.90g/t Au and 3m@2.66g/t Au. Drillhole FARC004 intersected 2 m @ 1.99gt Au and 4m@1.16g/t Au. Intersection widths are sample lengths and do therefore not necessarily present the true thickness of the mineralisation. Mineralisation could not be correlated between drillholes due to the poor understanding of the geology. Results of the drilling show that gold mineralisation does occur but these are inconclusive as to the prospectivity of the area.

In addition to the above, a total of 172 drillholes were drilled on the Barani East Prospect by Hyundai. Initial review of the drilling data and drilling method utilised after the buyout of Hyundai by Desert Gold TransAfrika was viewed as requiring validation. Desert Gold drilled a total of 17 additional drillholes on the Barani East Prospect in 2012, (of which 5 were diamond drillholes; the balance consisted of RC drillholes) for the purposes of confirmatory twinning drilling.

Review of the data and drilling methods by Mr Louw van Schalkwyk (VP Exploration and Director for Desert Gold at the time) after the completion of the 2012 drilling programme provided a basis for the validation of the drilling data generated by Hyundai. Desert Gold then conducted a data review and generated an updated validated database for the purposes of Mineral Resource estimation.

Of the 172 drillholes, 79 drillholes were used in the 2013 Mineral Resource estimation and geological modelling over the most prospective area at Barani East. Out of the 79 drillholes interpreted to intersect the mineralised zone, only 64 had verifiable assay data falling within the mineralised envelope, while the balance were utilised for the geological modelling only, outside the mineralised envelope. In 2015, Minxcon assisted Desert Gold by conducting a data capture exercise of outstanding drillhole data surrounding the core mineralised area (from the 1998 to 2003 Hyundai drilling programmes) in order to confirm and assist with better delineation of the original identified mineralised zone, as well as to identify additional exploration targets which were not available in 2013. 107 Drillholes from Barani East and 42 drillholes from Barani were added to the 2013 database of 79 drillholes, thus rendering a total dataset of 228 drillholes.

Of the 228 total drillholes, only 64 were interpreted to intersect the mineralised zone. Thus, no additional drillholes were utilised in the 2015 Mineral Resource estimate for the mineralised envelope, however the additional holes served to improve confidence in the mineralised envelope geometry and to prove, or validate the strike extent of the mineralised zone. Of the additional drillholes added in 2015, 31 constituted mineralised intersections and were used to identify exploration targets, of which only 26 were utilised due to assay data validation shortcomings on 5 of the drillholes.

Three holes were omitted from the Mineral Resource estimate and geological database as no supporting data could be found.

On Farabantourou, previous permit holders have found several apparently small, low grade targets and deposits. However, the understanding of the geology was, and still is, poor. The properties were undeveloped at the time that TransAfrika Mali acquired the permits. There are some artisanal workings on Farabantourou. The only work conducted on the Farabantourou Gold Mining Permit subsequent to the 2012 drilling programme has been a data validation exercise, data capture and 2 Mineral Resource estimates for the Barani East prospect area within the Farabantourou Gold Mining Permit.

Item 1 (g) – MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES

Mineral Resources The mineralised zone within the Barani East Prospect of Farabantourou ranges in width from approximately 4.5 m to 15 m, with the thicker portion of the mineralised zone found in the south. It strikes north-northeast to south-southwest, dipping toward the southeast at between 55° and 60°.The following tables summarise the Mineral Resources for Farabantourou - Barani East as at November, 2015 (estimated by Minxcon). Resources for Barani East are stated at a 0.5 g/t cut-off by Minxcon.

Item 1 (h) – QUALIFIED PERSON’S CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Conclusions Minxcon has reviewed all the information and has made the following observations regarding the Farabantourou Barani East Prospect:-
 Minxcon is of the opinion that the historical data on Barani East is acceptable in terms of collar survey and overall data quality after the site visit and after reviewing the drilling conducted during 2012.
 The main mineralised zone, a hanging wall and 2 footwall mineralised zones have been identified at Barani East, based upon a 0.3 g/t cut-off.
 The strike length of the orebody has increased from 650 m, to approximately 800 m due to the inclusion of the historical drilling to the north and south of the 2013 interpreted mineralised zone.
 Relative density data, though limited is of acceptable standard and is viewed as being representative of the host lithologies down to an approximate depth of 150 m below surface. Uncertainty exists below this limit. Minxcon revised the utilised RD down from 1.8 kg/dm³ to 1.6 kg/dm³ down to a depth of 78 m below surface and to 1.7 kg/dm³ below this.
 Exploration potential on Barani East is limited (except for the potential exploration hanging wall target), however on the greater Farabantourou Permit Area, 6 other exploration targets have been identified.
 Changes to the Mineral Resource are attributed to the change in RD applied during modelling, the adjusted modelled depth from a previous 250 m based on a perceived optimised mining constraint to a maximum depth of approximately 190 m based on the geostatistical modelling of the drillhole data and due to the additional historical data utilised in this Mineral Resource estimate as well as the change in the capping strategy applied during 2015.

Recommendations Minxcon recommends the following for the Farabantourou Barani East Prospect:-
 Minxcon recommends that Desert Gold implements a recognised, industry standard database for all its historical exploration data on a central server for the purposes of data security and preservation.
 It is recommended that Desert Gold do additional drilling around the potential exploration target identified in the hanging wall of the Barani prospect in order to possibly improve the resource.
 Other areas where historical drilling has taken place should be identified and similar data verification exercises undertaken in order to maximise the Resource yield within the Farabantourou Permit area.
 In the event of a preliminary economic assessment being successfully completed on the updated Mineral Resource, Minxcon recommends that additional infill drilling is undertaken to better delineate the mineralised zone prior to the commencement of mining.

Item 2 (d) – QUALIFIED PERSONS’ PERSONAL INSPECTION OF THE PROPERTY
A site visit to the Barani East Project within the greater Farabantourou Permit Area was conducted during the week of the 16th of November 2015 by Mr Uwe Engelmann, who is a director of Minxcon and a Qualified Person (“QP”; as that term is defined in NI43-101) for this Report. The diamond core and reverse circulation (“RC”) drilling chips were inspected, located at the Bamako office and Kéniéba camp. The site was visited to inspect exploration and Mineral Resource components pertaining the Mineral Resource estimation update covered by this Report, including the checking of the collar positions of the drillholes, the geology as well as the topography of the higher ferricrete cap topography in relation to lower lying saprolitic area.

The following was checked while on the site visit: Core for all the diamond drillholes drilled by Desert Gold;  RC chips for 50% of the RC holes drilled by Desert Gold; and  25 collar positions were verified – both from Desert Gold and previous operators Hyundai Mali SA (“Hyundai”).

COLLAR POSITIONS The drillhole collar positions that were verified are shown in Table 1 below.

DRILLHOLE VERIFICATION RC Chips

The following RC drillhole chips were inspected: BERC12-002;  BERC12-004;  BERC12-005;  BERC12-006;  BERC12-009; and  BERC12-010.

In all cases the observations in the RC chips correlated well with the drillhole logs that have been utilised in the modelling. The ferricrete capping that has been modelled and observed on the ground was intersected in the drillholes drilled on the higher lying area and was missing in the drillholes drilled on the lower lying area covered by saprolite. In some cases the term laterite and ferricrete appear interchangeable in the logs. This, however, does not alter the modelling of the ferricrete capping in the southwest. The RC chips illustrated that the rock or saprolite is generally very friable and soft in a large percentage of the hole. This lends itself to the thinking that a free dig mining operation could be viable here in the majority of the saprolite. The shale seems to be the more resistant lithology in the RC chips. In some cases the chip samples were reduced to powder. It is uncertain if this is due to the age of the chips or if this was the characteristic of the rock at the time of drilling.

No sulphides were observed in the RC chips within the mineralised zones that indicated higher gold grades. In addition to this, the mineralised zone could not be correlated to any specific lithology or colouration. The only characteristic that was observed in the mineralised zones is that there was evidence of quartz carbonate veining in the chips.

Visual identification of the mineralised zone could therefore be difficult during mining operations.

The inspection of the RC chips therefore confirmed that the drillhole data being utilised in the geological modelling and Mineral Resource estimation was reliable.

Diamond Core Drillholes

All five diamond core drillholes that were drilled by Desert Gold were inspected during the site visit. BEDD12001 and BEDD12-004 are stored in Bamako at the office and the remainder at the Kéniéba camp.

The core itself has deteriorated to a certain extent due to the storage arrangements at the office and Kéniéba camp. Therefore, the core would not be suitable for re-sampling and re-assaying if that was ever required. It is however still in a sufficiently satisfactory condition to identify different lithologies, rock characteristics and regolith zones (Figure 1).

Drillhole BEDD12-001 Core at the Bamako Office

November 2015

The drillhole core clearly confirmed the modelling of the ferricrete capping in the south-western portion (Figure 2), of the mineralised strike, and the saprolite in the north-eastern portion of the mineralised strike. BEDD12-001, BEDD12-002 and BEDD12-003 all intersected ferricrete (all fall within the higher lying ferricrete capped hill) and BEDD12-004 and BEDD12-005 did not intersect any ferricrete (both lie within the lower lying north-eastern portion of the model). Figure 3 shows the typical saprolite intersected beneath the ferricrete, or as in the case of the north-eastern portion, on surface.
During the inspection of the core it became apparent that the mineralised zones could not be correlated with any specific lithology nor could it be associated with colour or any other distinguishing feature. The only characteristic that it could be related to is with an increased presence of fine quartz carbonate veining (Figure 4). This has been interpreted as being a stockwork zone which is possibly related to the thrust fault interpreted by Hyundai.

The mineralised zone in BEDD12-002 was associated with a breccia zone as shown in Figure 5 (at the hand lens). This area also seemed to be more carbonaceous. In the case of BEDD12-003 the mineralised zone was associated with siltstone (Figure 6).

The core also gave an indication of the different competencies of the rock in the Project Area. It ranged from very competent in the ferricrete to almost powdery in the saprolite with the sandstone, siltstone and shale showing varying competencies depending on weathering. Figure 7 to Figure 9 illustrate the varying competencies of the rock in the Project Area.
Based on these observations, the density of 1.8 kg/m3 used in the initial estimation was revised to 1.6 kg/dm3 and 1.7 kg/dm3 because of the friable nature of the rock. These densities are based on the measurements taken at the time of drilling. The 1.6 kg/dm3 is from surface (excluding the ferricrete) to approximately 78 m below surface and from 78 m deeper, it was increased to 1.7 kg/dm3.

GEOLOGY AND TOPOGRAPHY The general topography of the Project Area is low lying undulating grasslands with thorn trees (Figure 10). These grasslands form part of the Sudanian Savanna which is a broad band of tropical savanna from Sudan westwards to Senegal. It is characterised by the coexistence of trees and grasses. The dominant trees are

the Combretaceaea, Caesalpinioideae and Acacia. The landscape is interrupted by higher lying areas due to sandstone mountains or ferricrete capped hills as is the case with the hill in the south-western portion of the mineralised strike (Figure 11). This higher topography, in relation to the drilling along the mineralised strike, is also illustrated in Figure 12 in red. The ferricrete can be also observed in Figure 11. The inspection of the drill core and the RC chips has confirmed that the thickness of the ferricrete cap ranges from about 3 m to 15 m.

 Brief quarterly reports must be submitted in the first two weeks of the quarter, detailing the previous quarter's activities;
 An annual report, submitted in the first quarter of the following year, detailing the year’s completed exploration activities; and
 Details of the reporting structure on exploration activities and reporting of sampling and exploration results are given in the Arretes.

A mining permit can be assigned only to the holder of a research permit or to the holder of a licence for prospecting. It can only cover the zone inside of the research and the substances for which it was attributed. It shall be automatically granted if the holder has complied with all the obligations mentioned under the deed of the research permit or the prospecting licence. A research permit shall remain valid over the remainder of its original surface area following the granting of a mining permit.

The mining permit grants to its holder, within the limits of its boundaries and to an indefinite depth, an exclusive right to prospecting, research and mining of mineral substances for which the research permit or the licence for prospecting that it derives from is valid, and for which the administration in charge of mines shall receive a Feasibility Study (“FS”) as a proof for a deposit mineable, a plan for community development and a plan for mine closure. It also grants to its holder the right to proceed with all processing operations and selling activity of concentrates. The permit is governed by a standard Convention Minière (Mining Convention) detailing the fiscal and legal regime under which the exploration permit was granted.

Minxcon is not qualified to provide legal opinion on the state of mineral tenure and has only relied on information supplied by the Client. This section is not intended as a due diligence or legal review.

Item 4 (d) – ISSUER’S TITLE TO/INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY
According to the Executive of Desert Gold, the shareholding of the Farabantourou permit is as follows: 74% to Desert Gold;  13% to International Business Holdings Limited; and  13% to Rock SARL.

In due course, once Desert Gold is granted a mining permit, a new company will be created where the shareholders must create a registered operating company under Mali law, under which the State shall take a 10% share free of all cost. This share is at no time subject to dilution even in case of any capital increase in the Company and the shares would be considered priority shares. When a net accountable profit is evidenced by the operating company, it will deduct from the distributable profit, i.e. the profit for the year less anterior losses and provisions for authorised re-investment, payment of income taxes and increased retained earnings beneficiaries, a preferred dividend to be paid to the State.

The State reserves the right to exercise its acquisition option of an additional 10% maximum interest to be paid in cash for the capital of the company. The national private investors have the option to acquire interest at a rate of at least 5% of the mining company shares, on the same conditions as the private

27

shareholders. The holder of a research permit or a licence for prospecting shall transfer the mining permit free of charge to the said operating company as soon as it is established.

The operating permit is granted by decree for a period of thirty years, renewable in run of ten years until depletion of the reserves contained within the boundaries of the permit. The above means that the final structure of the company will be one of the following permutations:-
a) Desert Gold Mali 90% and Mali Government 10%; or b) Desert Gold Mali 80% and Mali Government 20%; or c) Desert Gold Mali 85%, Mali Government 10%, local private investors 5%; or d) Desert Gold Mali 75%, Mali Government 20%, local private investors 5%.

Item 4 (e) – ROYALTIES AND PAYMENTS
Through Law No. 2012-015 of 27 February 2012, which established the Mining Code (“the new Mining Code”), the Malian National Assembly has adopted new legislation resulting in amendments to the Mining Code of 19 August 1999 (“the former Mining Code”). The political instability, which immediately followed the adoption of the law, delayed declaration of the new legislation. However, mining operators in Mali have recently been notified of the enactment of the new Mining Code. The new Mining Code is supplemented by Decree No. 2012-311/P-RM dated 21 June 2012 (“the new Mining Regulation”).

The new Mining Code, crafted with World Bank assistance, instituted a royalty rate of 3% for precious metals. For the purpose of the financial model a 3% royalty was used over the life of mine (“LoM”).

Special tax on certain products (“Impôt Spécial sur Certains Produits”) or (“ISCP”), calculated on the basis of turnover exclusive of value added tax (“VAT”), also continues to apply. However, while the Mining Code implies that the ISCP is payable in respect to substances in groups 1 to 4, the new Mining Regulation imposes a 3% ISCP only for substances in groups 1 and 2. This includes gold and the 3% was included for the purpose of the financial valuation. The substances in each of the groups are detailed as follows:-
 Group 1: diamond, emerald, sapphire, beryl, jade, opal, garnet, alexandrite, andalusite, chalcedony, quartz, tourmaline, and corundum.
 Group 2: gold, silver, platinum-group metals, copper, lead, molybdenum, zinc, titanium, vanadium, zirconium, niobium, tantalum, tungsten, rare earth metals, lithium, tin, cobalt and nickel.
 Group 3: iron, manganese, chrome and bauxite.  Group 4: uranium, thorium, shale, coal, lignite and peat coal.

Item 4 (f) – ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES
Under the Malian Mining Act, the conduct of mining activities must be accompanied by an Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”). The document has to be submitted by the mining company along with a feasibility report required to obtain a mine operating permit or quarry.

For the closure of mines, an operator is required to notify the Authority of its intention to close the mine at least three years before the final cessation of mining. The operator should provide, at the same time, a study of the environmental and social impact, and a social or environmental impact statement, as well as a plan for the closure and rehabilitation of the mine.

No EIA has been done at this stage of the Project but has to be completed before the application to mine is submitted. Desert Gold has a proposal that was prepared by Digby Wells and Associates (Pty) Limited (“Digby Wells”) for details regarding the work that will have to be completed regarding the environmental aspects of the Barani East properties and the impact of the operations on the surrounding areas. This is expected to be completed in the near future.

Item 4 (g) – PERMITS TO CONDUCT WORK
No permits other than the Farabantourou exploration permit have been issued.

Item 4 (h) – OTHER SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND RISKS
There is no reason to believe that there are any factors or risks that may affect the title, or the ability to perform work on the property. Access to the Farabantourou property is sometimes difficult during the months of September and October, at the height of the rainy season, However, access is generally possible as there are no rivers or streams on or near the property that are subject to major flooding during the rainy season. Exploration reports show that heat exhaustion and malaria can cause work to be delayed especially towards the end of summer.

ITEM 5 – ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

LOCAL

29
RESOURCES,

Item 5 (a) – TOPOGRAPHY, ELEVATION AND VEGETATION
The landscape around the Farabantourou permit area is generally flat and low lying at about 100 m to 175 m above mean sea level (“amsl”). The area consists of low hills and numerous shallow passing streams occur within the permit areas. The Falémé River (Senegal-Mali border) is to the south and west of the permit area, while the Tambaoura escarpment, a 100 m high wall of Taoudeni Basin sediments, forms part of the mountain range to the east. The Farabantourou Permit has narrow ridges in the north at about 95 m to 185 m amsl.
Kéniéba is largely vegetated by tall grass and wooded savannah (Figure 22). Abundant seasonal streams criss‐cross the area and flow southward into the Doundi River and from there westward into the Falémé River. The Falémé River runs north-south and forms part of the Mali‐Senegal border near the Farabantourou Permit. Land use consists of subsistence farming and grazing of domestic animals. Crops usually consist of maize, millet, rice, peanuts and melons. Stands of mango trees are present, particularly in lower lying areas near continuing watercourses. Domestic animals such as sheep, goats or cattle graze the largely grasscovered areas.

Item 5 (b) – ACCESS TO THE PROPERTY
The nearest paved road is the Trans-Sahel Highway which runs from Dakar, Senegal to N'Djamena, Chad via Kayes and Bamako in Mali. In Mali, the road is tarred and generally in good condition from Bamako up to approximately 120 km from Kayes. Thereafter, it is poorly maintained and badly potholed. Access to the Farabantourou Permit is via an unpaved road from the Trans-Sahel Highway at Kayes. This unpaved road

Desert Gold Ventures Inc. Technical Report on the Farabantourou Gold Mining Permit, Kéniéba District, Western Mali

30

runs parallel to the Senegal border from Kayes to the town of Kéniéba. This road may become impassable in the rainy season due to flooding and deterioration of the road surface.

Year-round access to the Farabantourou Permit is possible as there are no rivers or streams on or near the property that are subject to major flooding during the rainy season. No telephone, electricity or water services are available in or around the permit area. The town of Kéniéba, 70 km to the south, has an airstrip, but no rail link is available.

Item 5 (c) – PROXIMITY TO POPULATION CENTRES AND NATURE OF TRANSPORT
Kéniéba is a rural community and the seat of Kéniéba Cercle in Mali's Kayes Region. In addition to the main town, the community includes 26 other villages. The 2009 census reported a population of 39,557. The main economic activities are commercial mining, livestock farming, seasonal crop growing and some artisanal gold workings. In general, the populations of both Mali and Senegal are poorly educated and generally unskilled. Because Mali has operating gold mines there is some skilled and semi-skilled labour amongst the local population but the extent of unutilised capacity is unknown.

Apparently most equipment and supplies are imported from Europe to the port of Dakar in Senegal and shipped by rail to Kayes then transported by truck to the Property Area. There is an airport in Kayes, which is also connected by bus and train service to Bamako. The travel time between Bamako to the town of Kéniéba is about 5 to 6 hours.

Item 5 (d) – CLIMATE AND LENGTH OF OPERATING SEASON
The climate of these parts of Mali varies from tropical to subtropical to dry. The following describes the general climate:-
 hot and dry between February and June;  rainy and humid between June and November; and  cool and dry between November and February.

Locally, the climate in the Kéniéba District is distinctly tropical with only two seasons, i.e. a wet season from June to October and a dry season from November to May. The average temperature ranges between 14°C and 37°C in Kéniéba. During the peak summer months, temperatures range between 21°C and 37°C. In the winter months of December and January, the temperature varies between 14°C and 29°C. The average temperatures are more moderate (17°C to 28°C on average) in the wet season.

Kéniéba Average Temperatures

November 2015

Rainfall data recorded from the Kéniéba District indicates that the wet season begins in June and ends in October. During the rainy season, measurable precipitation can exceed 18 mm to 20 mm. Peak rainfall can exceed 75 mm per day. Kéniéba is subjected to an average of 1,153 mm of rainfall per year, or 96 mm per month. The wettest weather is in August when an average of 230 mm of rainfall occurs. The driest weather occurs in December and January when an average of 0 mm of rainfall occurs.

Item 5 (e) – INFRASTRUCTURE
Local infrastructure in the Kéniéba District is poor, with few supplies or support services available. There is some gravity-fed public water supply in Kéniéba and the surrounding villages are supplied by boreholes. Mines are responsible for their own water supplies.
There is no national grid near the permit area and mines are responsible for their own power supply. Electricity is supplied by diesel power generators in many of the villages. The closest potential source of hydro-electrical power is the Manantali Dam located about 100 km to the northeast of the property on the Bafing River, a tributary of the Senegal River which flows northwest to the Atlantic Ocean. The power produced is split between Mali, Senegal and Mauritania and is very unreliable. Plans to utilise this as a source of power for Randgold’s Loulo Mine never came to fruition and all mines in the region depend on dieselgenerated electricity.
The state telephone company, SOTELMA, operates a telephone service in the village of Kéniéba. Cellular telephones are connected to the national grid and communication around Farabantourou is possible by cellular phones. Health services are poor with the nearest basic health services found in Kayes and Kéniéba with more advanced services limited to Bamako. Serious medical conditions would require evacuation to Europe or South Africa.
A water pipeline and diesel power generators have been included in the capital estimates for Barani East. Other than that the Project will rely on use of the existing road infrastructure. Referring to Figure 20, a new road was constructed near the south of the Farabantourou permit area via Kita from Bamako to Saraya, in Senegal and would serve Barani East.

ITEM 6 – HISTORY

33

Item 6 (a) – PRIOR OWNERSHIP AND OWNERSHIP CHANGES
Desert Gold acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of TransAfrika in 2011, thus Desert Gold has acquired a 74% holding in all of the previous TransAfrika projects in Mali, including the Farabantourou Permit. The remaining shares are held equally by the joint venture partners Rock SARL and IBHL.
Item 6 (b) – HISTORICAL EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT
The Farabantourou licence area has undergone a series of structured exploration investigations since 1998. The first company to conduct exploration activities in this area was Hyundai as part of their Sepola Project (Hyde 2001, Hyundai Mali 2004). Hyundai held the permit from 1998 until 2004. Some of the data from the 1998-2001 drilling programmes is available in the public domain. Desert Gold has undertaken exploration ranging from satellite imagery interpretation through to RC and diamond drilling of identified soil geochemistry and geophysical targets. Airborne magnetic and spectrometric surveys have been conducted over the whole of the Project Area (by the Mali Government) and soil geochemistry and induced polarisation (“IP”) surveys were carried out (2010) over targets identified (Barani, Barani East, Keniegoulou, Dambamba, Kousilli and Linnguekoto) by Desert Gold.
Between October 2001 and June 2002, 823 RC drillholes were drilled producing a total of 53,139 m of drillhole data (Figure 25). This drilling programme was a follow-up on targets identified by geochemical surveys, aeromagnetic surveys and artisanal workings. Mineralisation was discovered in six areas, namely Barani, Barani East, Keniegoulou, Dambamba, Kousilli and Linnguekoto (Figure 26). By June 2001, 63 drillholes (5,628 m drilled), returning 54 mineralised intersections, were drilled on the Barani East Prospect. Mineralisation was tested over 1,200 m of strike.

Exploration undertaken by Desert Gold on the Farabantourou Permit was aimed at identifying drill targets. The exploration work undertaken by Desert Gold on Farabantourou comprises:-
 Interpretation of satellite imagery covering the area;  Regional soil sampling over the western part of the permit, with additional infill soil sampling.
Samples were taken on 100 m spaced lines and on a sample interval of 50 m. Sampling was completed in an east-west and on a south-southwest to north-northeast grid;  A first phase of RC drilling of the gold anomalous zone identified by Hyundai. In total, 10 additional drillholes were completed; and  IP surveys, completed by Spectral Geophysics.
A series of IP surveys was completed by Spectral Geophysics in early January 2010 over the Kousilli target area. In addition, IP Surveys were also subsequently carried out on the Dambamba, Keniegoulou South, Keniegoulou and the Barani (inclusive of Barani East) areas of the permit. The soil anomalies from the earlier sampling programme were shown to coincide with structures interpreted from the chargeability maps in five areas on the grid.
Ten RC drillholes were drilled (totalling 978 m drilled) over one of the identified soil anomalies in the eastern part of the Kousilli area. Only two of the drillholes, FARC004 and FARC005, intersected any significant mineralisation. Drillhole FARC005 intersected 18 m at 1.26 g/t Au. This intersection includes 4 m at 2.90 g/t Au and 3 m at 2.66 g/t Au. Drillhole FARC004 intersected 2 m at 1.99 g/t Au and 4 m at 1.16 g/t Au. Intersection widths are sample lengths and do therefore not necessarily represent the true thickness of

the mineralisation. Mineralisation could not be correlated between drillholes due to the poor understanding of the geology. Results of the drilling show that gold mineralisation does occur but these are inconclusive as to the prospectivity of the area.

In addition to the above, a total of 79 RC drillholes were later drilled on the Barani East Project, of which 17 were drilled in 2012. Five of these 17 drillholes were diamond drillholes, while the balance was RC drillholes. On Farabantourou, previous holders of the permit have found several apparently small, low grade targets and deposits. However, the understanding of the geology was, and still is poor, and the historical drilling programmes do not appear to have been well-planned. The properties were undeveloped at the time that TransAfrika Mali acquired the permits. There are some artisanal workings on Farabantourou.

Item 6 (c) – HISTORICAL MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES
In the 2004 annual report to the DNGM-Mali, it was reported that the Resource Services Group (“RRD”) of Perth, Australia (later renamed to Coffey Mining Limited, “Coffey”)) undertook a Mineral Resource estimate over the current Farabantourou area plus additional ground then held by Hyundai. According to the report in question, Mineral Resources compliant with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (“JORC”) Code were estimated for several projects, including Barani East. The largest of the Mineral Resources stated was at Barani East, which presented a Mineral Resource of 745,000 t at a grade of 2.5 g/t Au for 59,000 oz Au, based on 190 drillholes for a total of 13,603 m of drilling. The Mineral Resource (Table 3) was stated as being conducted at a composited sample 0.5 g/t grade cut-off, over a minimum width of 2 m, not including more than 2 m of internal dilution. It is not clear how the 2004 Mineral Resource area compares to that of the current estimated Barani East Project Area.

An initial review conducted by TransAfrika of Hyundai's work indicated that drillhole twinning was required to assist with validating the historical Hyundai data and drillhole collars. It became apparent to TransAfrika that different exploration teams in different years had not necessarily used the same reference coordinate system. As a result, the actual drillhole positions were considered questionable until validation had been completed. In addition, documentation on the drilling programmes was considered to be of poor quality. The result was that Coffey, in their 2011 independent NI 43-101 Technical Report indicated that no Mineral Resources were declarable for the Farabantourou Prospect at that time, this after presenting a JORC compliant Mineral Resource estimate for Farabantourou, including Barani East in 2004.

Desert Gold personnel (under the guidance of Mr Louw van Schalkwyk) undertook a data validation exercise in 2012 by means of twinning some historical Hyundai holes. Subsequent to their 2012 drilling programme, a total of 79 drillholes (inclusive of the 5 diamond and 12 RC drillholes) in the central portion of the Barani East prospect were validated and presented to Minxcon for Mineral Resource estimation. Data was viewed as being acceptable for the purposes of Mineral Resource estimation due to similar rendition of the mineralised zone between results obtained during the 2012 drilling programme as compared to the historical Hyundai drilling programmes.

ITEM 7 – GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALISATION

37

Item 7 (a) - REGIONAL GEOLOGY
Regional Geology The area along the Senegal-Mali border is underlain by Proterozoic and Archaean rocks of the West Africa Craton. The craton stabilised at approximately 1,800 Ma and is composed of the Reguibat Shield to the north and the Leo or Man Shield to the south. The Leo Shield is built on an Archaean nucleus with the Baoul-Mossi (Proterozoic) Domain forming the majority of the shield in the southwest (Kusnir, 1999). The Baoul-Mossi Domain contains inliers of Archaean rocks and Birimian formations which were deposited between 2,300 Ma and 1,900 Ma. The Birimian rocks were affected by the Eburnean Orogeny which was most active from 2,000 Ma to 1,800 Ma, peaking at approximately 1,950 Ma. One of these inliers is the Kédougou-Kéniéba Inlier (“Kéniéba Inlier”), a north-northwest trending granite-greenstone belt which occurs along the Mali-Senegal border (Figure 27). The Kéniéba Inlier consists of Birimian volcano-sedimentary formations regionally metamorphosed to greenschist facies and intruded by large granitoid-gneiss complexes (Hyde, 2001).
Figure 27: Regional Geological Setting of the Farabantourou Permit Area Relative to the Birimian Greenstone Lithologies

WGS84

During the intrusion of the granitoid-gneiss terrains, major north-northwest trending suture zones developed. The extensive north-trending Senegal-Mali Fault Zone (“SMFZ”) is interpreted to be such a suture and is the main structural feature of the Kéniéba Inlier (Hyde, 2001).
The gold deposits within the Kéniéba Inlier are mostly contained within secondary structures and splay faults associated with the SMFZ, often where southeast to northwest sutures cross-cut the dominant structural fabric. It is generally accepted that fault and shear structures in the region provided the conduits to pregnant hydrothermal fluids, and now host the often extensive gold mineralisation. These zones are characterised by hydrothermally-introduced mineralisation within dilation zones with the gold deposits

hosted by penetrative shears and not by a single structural feature, implying the possibility of discovering additional significant gold deposits (Hyde, 2001). Several well-known gold deposits occur within the Kéniéba Inlier, these include Sadiola, Yatela, Tabakoto and Segala, Loulo and Sabodala.

The Kéniéba inlier is divided into three main stratigraphic units from west to east and from oldest to youngest: the Mako Supergroup, the Diale Supergroup and the Daléma Supergroup (Figure 28 and Figure 29).
 Mako Supergroup: This Supergroup hosts the well-known Sabodala Mine. The Sabodala Mine is located in an area of intense shearing and silicification and hosts pyrite with associated gold mineralisation. Typical lithologies include basalt flows; often carbonate alterations and minor volcaniclastic intercalations, magnesium basalt or komatiites, ultramafic sub-volcanic intrusions (pyroxenites) and numerous massive biotite and amphibole granitoids. These granitoid intrusions are suspected to have been “heat engines” which sparked off the deep mineralised magmatic fluids related to the later mineralisation in the inlier.
 Diale Supergroup: The Diale Supergroup lithologies are located between the Mako Supergroup and the western edge of the Saraya granite and is weakly metamorphic. It includes extensively folded formations, deposited after those of the Mako Supergroup and consists of shale, greywacke, quartzite and volcano-detritic rocks.
 Daléma Supergroup: The Daléma Supergroup continues into Mali in its eastern part but disappears in the south under the Madina-Kouta Basins. It is composed of volcano-sedimentary schist and graywackes.

Item 7 (b) - LOCAL AND PROPERTY GEOLOGY
Local Geology Apart from immediate mine areas, knowledge about the local geology is somewhat poor. Thick laterite and soil cover make outcrop scarce and make high resolution aeromagnetic data essential for structural interpretation. Ground and geophysical mapping have only been carried out on a regional scale by national and international government agencies.
The preliminary geological interpretation of the Farabantourou permit area (Figure 30) was constructed utilising the regional aeromagnetic data and regional geological maps. A north-northwest to south-southeast striking structural discontinuity is seen to form the contact between the western sedimentary units and the eastern volcano-sedimentary units. This prominent feature has been interpreted to be part of the SMFZ. In addition, north-northeast striking dykes cut through in some areas of the permit.
The siliciclastic sediments to the west of the SMFZ, consist of sandstones, siltstones and conglomerates belonging to the Kéniébandi Formation. Coarse-grained sandstones and conglomerates have a significant volcanic content and appear to grade into rhyolitic pyroclastics and lavas to the west. Siliciclastic sediments underlay the largest part of the permit, the bulk of which consists of sandstones, siltstones and conglomerates. Mafic volcanic rocks cause magnetic highs in the north-eastern part of the permit. Faulting is prominent throughout the permit area.

WGS84

Property Geology The Barani East area in the north-eastern corner of the Farabantourou Permit Area is interpreted to consist primarily of volcano-sedimentary lithologies and lies to the east of the SMSZ. The primary lithologies are carbonate-rich siltstone and shale. The mineralised zone is weathered to an approximate depth of 150 m. The southern portion of the mineralised zone is capped by a ferricrete layer estimated to be approximately 10 m in thickness and overlies a saprolite zone of approximately 20 m thick, thus the geology of this portion, with respect the structure and buried lithologies, is largely interpretative (Figure 31). The gold mineralisation is thought to be associated with quartz-hematite rocks and kaolinite veins hosted in carbonate-rich siltstone and shale, under the influence of an interpreted thrust fault in the footwall of the mineralised zone. This interpretation has essentially not changed since Hyundai first drilled on the property.

The gold mineralisation is mesothermal in origin and occurs as free gold in quartz vein stockworks and zones of silicification, associated with arsenopyrite and to a lesser extent, pyrite and antimony. The primary lithologies are siltstone and shale. The mineralised zone is weathered to an approximate depth of 150 m. The southern portion of the mineralised zone is capped by a ferricrete layer estimated to be approximately 10 m in thickness, which overlies a saprolite zone of approximately 20 m thickness. The grade within the mineralised generally varies between 1.2 g/t to 3.8 g/t. at a cut-off grade of 1 g/t, the grade of the mineralised zone is approximately 2.5 g/t. Upside potential exists in the form of the hanging wall lithologies not being entirely barren. Minor mineralised zones are known to occur, however, these are not discretely discernible. The current interpreted length of the mineralised zone is approximately 800 m and has been modelled to a maximum depth of 240 m below surface, depending on the surface topography.

ITEM 8 – DEPOSIT TYPES

44

The principal exploration targets and focus of exploration to date within the Kéniéba Inlier is what can most appropriately be termed orogenic gold. Common sub-types of this class of deposit type include lode, quartz vein and shearzone-related gold, with the underlying similarity being that they all formed as part of an orogenic (collisional) tectonic event. Other terms used to describe these deposits are mesothermal, shearzone-hosted and Greenstone gold deposits.
Item 8 (a) – MINERAL DEPOSITS BEING INVESTIGATED
Orogenic gold deposits, with specific reference to “mesothermal deposits”, are primary deposits formed at intermediate depths within the earth's crust. Shearzone deposits refers to the fact that the larger deposits are often in or immediately adjacent to large fault zones. Greenstone gold deposits are hosted in volcanosedimentary terranes associated with granitic intrusions, metamorphosed to greenschist facies metamorphic grade and are usually Archaean in age. This term is applied to the Birimian lithologies as found in West Africa, due to the similarities in the geology to the Archaean gold deposits.
Orogenic gold deposits can be described as gold-bearing quartz veins, stringers and wallrock accompanied by only minor sulphides that are localised by brittle to ductile structures within variable rock types. These deposits account for up to 18% of the world's gold production, ranking them second only to production from placer deposits. Deposits range in size from 0.5 t to 1,600 t of contained gold with most, typically containing between 1 t and 20 t Au. Gold grades are highly variable, but deposit values of greater than 1 g/t Au form attractive targets for open-pit mining whilst, deposits with a value of greater than 5 g/t Au may prove economic for underground operations. World-class orogenic gold deposits of this type occur in various countries, including Australia, Brazil, DRC, Canada, Ghana, Tanzania, USA and Zimbabwe.
The rock types that host orogenic gold deposits are highly varied. Orogenic gold deposits are hosted by rocks that have been subjected to a range of metamorphic conditions (from sub-greenschist though to granulite facies). However, the majority of deposits (and especially the larger ones) occur within rocks that have been metamorphosed to greenschist facies (within a metamorphic pressure-temperature regime broadly corresponding to the brittle-ductile transition).
Where individual gold deposits have been described and compared, the nature of the gold distribution was found to be highly variable between deposits. Mineralisation occurs in swarms of discontinuous veins of varying thickness and extent and as disseminated impregnations in sheared and altered rock. Gold may occur as native gold and/or associated with sulphides. Pyrite and arsenopyrite are the most commonly reported sulphides associated with these deposits. Veins may follow brittle fractures, bedding planes, shear zones and schistosity.
Item 8 (b) – GEOLOGICAL MODEL
The 2015 Barani East Mineral Resource model utilised wireframes constructed in the Leapfrog™ geomodeling Software and the various drillhole files relevant to the modelling update exercise requisitioned by Desert Gold were received from Desert Gold in the form of MS Excel Spreadsheets. These spreadsheets were previously utilised in the 2013 and 2014 Minxcon Mineral Resource estimation and included a total of 79 drillholes including 5 diamond and 12 RC drillholes drilled by Desert Gold. Additional historical drillhole data was provided in the form of digital .pdf section sheets, with only assay and no lithological information.
GEOLOGICAL WIREFRAME MODEL Once the drillhole file was finalised, Minxcon started investigating the drillhole file to try to determine any relationship between lithology, geological structure and mineralisation. Due to the vast majority of holes

being RC drillholes and due to the poor core preservation, Minxcon was unable to find any direct lithological correlatives to the mineralisation. Minxcon was forced to revert to the historical interpretation of a dipping mineralised zone, towards the east, based on mineralisation only, with the inference of a possible thrust fault in the footwall of the deposit. Minxcon subsequently conducted a grade filter of 0.3 g/t in order to see if there were any possible mineral zones that were visually correlateable.

Only one main zone was identified, along with a 2 less continuous hanging wall mineralised zones and one footwall zone. This was on the same strike as the originally interpreted mineralised zone strike interpreted by Hyundai and during subsequent Mineral Resource estimates. Minxcon then tied these intersections by means of constructing extrapolation strings down the dip and along the strike of the mineralised zone. Mineralised material was allowed to contain up to 50% of its sampled length, as material of grade less than 0.3 g/t Leapfrog™ was then utilised grid a smooth surface between the extrapolated strings. The Resultant mineralised zone wireframes may be viewed in Figure 33.

The ferricrete or laterite horizon capping the mineralised zone in the south of the Project Area was then generated based on the logged intervals from the 2013 drillhole dataset. The mineralise wireframes were then cut off against the ferricrete in order to generate an accurate surface chronology and to exclude this material from the Mineral Resource estimate.

Topographical contours were received from Desert Gold. These were then combined with the drillhole collars and use to generate an all-inclusive topographical surface. Previous estimates did not have contour strings and only utilised the drillhole collars to generate a surface topography. An oblique, section view of the completed topography, base of ferricrete and the mineralised zone wireframes modelled for the purposes of the 2015 Mineral Resource estimate is presented in Figure 34.

Minxcon then projected the topography down 78 m in order to create the 2 specific density domains. The upper 78 m domain was allocated an RD of 1.6, while the lower domain was allocated an RD of 1.7 m. The interpreted depth and the values were interpreted from downhole plots of the density. Density was not able to be estimated from the data directly into the block model, as these are viewed as not being representative, with only 55 measurements being taken.

Item 9 (a) – SURVEY PROCEDURES AND PARAMETERS
This section summarises the exploration activities other than drilling undertaken during the history of Barani East within the Farabantourou Permit Area.
The Mali government undertook a region-wide aeromagnetic survey which also included the Farabantourou area. The results of this were promising and further airborne geophysical work was undertaken, including magnetic and spectrometry surveys (Fugro Airborne Surveys), which was followed by ground magnetic survey (Abitibi Geophysics) by Hyundai. Figure 35 shows the portions of the Farabantourou Licence Area covered by the survey work.

Subsequent to this, Desert Gold initiated two phases of IP surveys: the first phase was undertaken by Spectral Geophysics and the second phase by Geospec International. In Phase 1, a localised northwest grid (Figure 38) was carried out in a pole-dipole configuration of 19 lines spaced 200 m apart, with lengths ranging from 1.8 km to 3 km in an east-west direction. Two additional lines (Lines 20 and 21, (Figure 38) running northeast to southwest were also completed to test a geochemical anomaly.
In Phase 2, four areas were covered by pole-dipole configurations (Figure 38): Barani: a total of 50.4 line km consisting of 14 lines spaced 200 m apart, with each line being 3.6 km in length.  Keniegoulou: a total of 35 line km consisting of 10 lines spaced 200 m apart, with each line being 3.5 km in length.  Keniegoulou South: a total of 40 line km consisting of 16 lines spaced at 200 m intervals, with each line being 2.5 km in length.  Dambamba: a total of 33 line km consisting of 11 lines spaced at 200 m intervals, with each line being 3.0 km in length.

The data processing included standard IP analytical methodology to obtain resistivity and chargeability values which allows the interpretation of pseudo-depth sections and inverse modelling to obtain a 3D volume over the studied areas.
Figure 39 shows a pseudo-section from the results after processing of the data and Figure 40 shows a depth (-244 m) slice obtained from the inverse modelling of the chargeability results. From these IP traverses a series of structural lineaments could be interpreted over Barani East (Figure 40) as well as the six target areas identified (Figure 41).

Item 9 (b) - SAMPLING METHODS AND SAMPLE QUALITY
Sampling and sampling methods are determined by many factors, of which the expected type of mineralisation and expected orientation of the mineralised zones are the major factors influencing the techniques and methods employed.

The mineralisation in the Farabantourou License area is expected to conform to the majority of the other gold occurrences in Western Mali that is hydrothermally emplaced gold within sulphide complexes confined to structural domains such as shear zones and fault planes. The geometry of the mineralisation is commonly elongated, and thin-zoned with steep dips. In the Farabantourou Permit Area that translates to between 50° and 70°dipping mostly to the south and southeast. The interpreted local fault zones are shown in Figure 41.

GEOPHYSICS Airborne Magnetics and Spectrometry

These methods have been employed in delineating exploration targets in West Africa with a high degree of success. The sample intervals as well as flight path orientation is considered to be adequate to ensure the best results in this type of geological setting. The survey was carried out by a reputable firm and it can be assumed that all industry acceptable standard procedures and QA/QC methods were obtained in data gathering as well as post-processing.
Ground Magnetics
To obtain a better resolution picture of the airborne data, a ground magnetic survey is usually employed over areas of interest. In this instance the work was done by a reputable firm and it can be safely accepted that all proper QA/QC and international best practices were followed during the data collection and data interpretation stages of this work.

Ground IP
IP surveys are an acceptable method of delineating targets where the mineralisation is considered to be in some form of sulphide complex. The amount of lines and the target areas covered by the IP work is considered to be adequate to be representative of the prospective targets identified with other geophysical methods. It can be accepted that the surveys were carried out in accordance with industry standards and best practices during data collection in the field and post-processing in the office, as the work was done by a reputable geophysical service provider.

GEOCHEMISTRY The soil sampling was carried out on 400 m line spacing, at 100 m intervals on east-west and south-southwest to north-northeast trending lines. The anomalies encountered were then treated to infill sampling at 100 m line spacing and samples collected at 50 m intervals. This is in line with common industry standard practises and the expected strike of the mineralised zones. QA/QC was adhered to by the laboratory responsible for the analysis, ALS Minerals (Mali) and certificates of the relevant QA/QC work was delivered along with the results to the Client.

Item 9 (c) – SAMPLE DATA
Airborne geophysical data (magnetic and spectrometry) was collected on a regional scale as well as over the whole of the license area with higher resolution ground magnetics carried out over predominantly the eastern areas, mostly targeting Barani, Barani East, Keniegoulou and Linnguekoto (Figure 35).

A total of 2,223 soil samples, including field duplicates and reference standards, were collected and assayed. As can be seen in Figure 37 the exploration targets as delineated by the geophysics was comprehensively covered. The sampling was carried out on 400 m spaced grids with samples collected at 100 m intervals and this was followed up with infill sampling at 100 m line spacing and samples collected at 50 m intervals along the grid lines.

An IP survey was completed by Spectral Geophysics, a geophysical consulting company from Botswana. The survey, completed in early January 2010, was done over 51 grid lines, with 159 line km of IP data collected. The areas covered by the IP survey was mostly in the northern part of the Farabantourou license area as can be seen in Figure 38.

Item 9 (d) – RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION OF EXPLORATION INFORMATION
Through the exploration history of the Project, various techniques were employed. The results of each technique were used to further define the identified target areas in higher resolution until a Mineral Resource could be defined from drilling information.

The exploration techniques started at project level with airborne magnetic surveys coupled with airborne spectrometry surveys, which delineated a number of targets within the larger license area. These targets were then tested with ground magnetic surveys and soil sampling surveys. This increased the resolution of the target areas which were then further explored by IP. This allowed structural interpretation and when overlain by the results of the soil sampling, drilling targets were delineated.

A total of 2,223 soil samples, including field duplicates and reference standards, were collected and assayed. Anomalous gold in soil includes values of 441 ppb Au, 502 ppb Au and 1,683 ppb Au. A 3,500 m zone of discontinuous gold-in-soil anomalies coincide with a northwest-southeast striking magnetic high over the Kousilli prospect and soil anomalies coincide with structures interpreted from the chargeability maps in five areas on the grid (Figure 42).

The drilling results could be used to develop a geological and grade distribution model as can be seen in Figure 43, which Desert Gold developed from previous Hyundai data. Figure 43 also shows that significant gold grades were reported over substantial mineralisation zone thicknesses. Further target drilling in 2012 by Desert Gold in the Barani East area highlighted the following results from drill intersections (above 0.5 g/t Au):-
 BERC12-002: 7.81g/t au from 17 m to 30 m. Estimated true width of 11.5 m;  BERC12-003: 8.40g/t au from 26 m to 36 m. Estimated true width of 8 m; and  BERC12-005: 3.54g/t au from 1 m to 9 m. Estimated true width of 7 m.

ITEM 10 – DRILLING

55

Unless otherwise stated, all drillhole intersections are reported as sample lengths and may not represent true thickness.
Item 10 (a) – TYPE AND EXTENT OF DRILLING
Desert Gold has a significant database of drill results on the Farabantourou tenement. Between October 2001 and June 2002, 823 RC drillholes were drilled producing a total of 53,139 m of drillhole data. This drilling programme was a follow-up on targets identified by geochemical surveys, aeromagnetic surveys and artisanal workings. Mineralisation was discovered in six areas, namely Barani, Barani East, Keniegoulou, Dambamba, Kousilli and Linnguekoto (Figure 44). By June 2001, 63 drillholes (5,628 m) and 54 mineralised intersections were drilled on the Barani East Prospect. Mineralisation was tested over 1,200 m of strike.
Drilling to date intercepted many areas of mineralisation, which require further examination. However, due to the mineralisation at Barani East being considered to have the potential to contain a significant resource, much of the recent activity was, and continues to be, focused on this prospect. Results from the drilling were found to be sufficient to define a Mineral Resource.
The targets were drilled in three phases: first general target drilling by RC, followed by RC drilling focussed on Kousilli and, lastly, some additional RC drilling and diamond core drilling on Barani East (Figure 44). Only 12 RC drillholes and five diamond drillholes have recently been drilled at Barani East (during 2012) under the auspices of Desert Gold in order to assess the nature of the mineralised zone and to assess the quality of the drilling data of historical operators.

From the preceding discussion it can be seen that exploration was taken up to resource estimation level only in one of the six target areas, namely Barani East. The Mineral Resource estimate conducted by Minxcon, on Barani East, was based on a combination of historical RC drillholes, as well as the more recent 12 RC holes and the five diamond drillholes conducted under the auspices of TransAfrika and Desert Gold under the management of Coffey.

The majority of the holes were drilled at approximately -60° in order to cut the mineralised zone as close as possible at right angles. A total of 695 m of RC drilling was recorded for the 12 drillholes drilled on Barani East during the 2012 drilling programme. RC drilled depths ranged from 30 m up to 120 m in length. In addition, a total of 452 m of diamond core drilling was recorded for the five diamond drillholes drilled on Barani East during the 2012 drilling programme. The diamond drillholes reached depths of between 75 m and 130 m.

Surface Drilling Procedures (RC and Diamond Drilling) The following part of the Report is a list of the field standards and procedures that were followed for the Barani East drilling programme managed by Coffey. All drilling was undertaken by reputable drilling contractors to industry standard. Diamond drilling produced HQ (63.50 mm) and NQ (47.60 mm) size core. Generally, drillholes commenced with HQ and were drilled to more competent material below the saprolite before casing off HQ and then continued with NQ to the end of drillhole. In all drillholes the rock was moderately fractured yielding core pieces usually less than 50 cm, but core recovery in the competent rock was greater than 90%. Sample recovery in the RC drillholes appears to have been within acceptable limits. Geologist reports and logs do not indicate any serious problems.

Location of Planned Drillhole Sites The planned drillhole sites were located in the field by the geologist using a hand-held GPS with an estimated accuracy of ± 5 m. The responsible person representing the drilling company accompanied the project geologist whilst the drillhole sites were being laid out. All the coordinates for the planned drillhole sites were supplied to the field geologist.

Presentation of Core The core was placed in 10 m lengths with each drill run interval marked on the core with an indelible black ink pen. The core was laid out with interlocking splits to ensure that there was no artificial gain in m. All drillhole m and stick-ups would have been recorded by the responsible drilling foreman and these figures made available to the geologist.

End of Hole The progress of the drillholes was stopped by the geologist upon instruction from Coffey.

Final Survey of Holes The collar positions were measured in the field by means of a hand-held GPS, conducted by the field geologist to an accuracy of ± 5 m. The final downhole survey of the drillholes was conducted by contract surveyors utilising a using a Reflex-IT instrument. Downhole survey measurements were taken directly below the casing at 6 m downhole depth, and thereafter at 24 m intervals, down to the end of the hole.

Recording of Geological Features All core and RC chips were logged to industry standard using a set of defined lithological codes. The following geological features were recorded by the geologist:-
 Lithology or rock type;  Colour;  Grain-size;

Desert Gold Ventures Inc. Technical Report on the Farabantourou Gold Mining Permit, Kéniéba District, Western Mali

57

 Geological structures;  Mineralisation type;  Alteration type when present;  Quartz veining when present;  Sulphide type when present;  Sulphide percent when present;  Level of oxidation;  Weathering zone; and  Sample quality.

Chain of Custody According to Desert Gold, samples were subject to a full chain-of-custody process at all times from the sampling to the analytical laboratory. The details of the samples to be submitted were recorded on standard documentation on site. The samples were checked by sampling personnel and the geologists prior to shipment. This was provided with the dispatch notes. Any discrepancies on receipt by the laboratory were flagged for follow-up. The assay certificates were e-mailed to the project geologist as *.csv and *.pdf files. Cross-checking of the assay certificates with the results was possible as these included details of each batch, including the shipment codes. Samples were road freighted by Desert Gold or their contractors from site to laboratories in Kayes and Bamako, Mali.

Relative Density Relative density (“RD”) measurements of samples were not taken as routine. However, the diamond drilling conducted at Barani East offered the perfect opportunity to conduct RD measurements, where the submersion methodology was employed utilising the Archimedes Principle.

A Snowrex NHV3 precision scale was used to weigh samples. The scale was supplied by Geo Explore Store. A quality control certificate was supplied with the scale. The scale was set up indoors, away from magnetic or high-voltage equipment as specified in the accompanying user manual.

A total of 45 samples were selected from drillholes BEDD12_001 and BEDD12_004. It was found that RD values for specific lithologies increase in the deeper parts of the drillholes, indicating less weathered material at depth. RDs varied between 1.43 kg/dm³ and 2.22 kg/dm³. Only 45 RD measurements were taken in total and these were not considered to be adequate to generate an estimate. Minxcon grouped the data at 10 m depth intervals, based on downhole depth. All drillholes were drilled at a dip of -60°, thus equating to a trigonometric depth correction. A change is observable at the 90 m downhole depth mark, which equates to a 78 m vertical depth below surface. Minxcon viewed the measured RD data and applied an RD of 1.6 kg/dm³ above the 78 m elevation and an RD of 1.7 kg/dm³ below the 78 m interface. The graph for the downhole RD maximums, minimums and averages is presented below in Figure 45.

Storage of Core and RC Samples Drillhole core, duplicates of RC sample chips and reference material of RC chips in chip trays are stored in a locked compound at the field office in Kéniéba, which is permanently guarded by security personnel. The remaining RC sample chip rejects were left at the drill site and have not been retained.

the Mineral Resource estimation exercise. However, Coffey has attested to the quality of the results and has also officially signed off the QA/QC for the 2012 drilling programme (McKinney, 2013). Minxcon reviewed the QA/QC report and it graphs and concurs with Coffeys’ findings that the drillholes from the 2012 drilling programme are useable for the purposes of Mineral Resource estimation.

Historical data received by Minxcon from Desert Gold was considered in conjunction with the new drillhole data during the modelling process and no anomalies were found with respect to drillhole surveys or drillhole collars. The mineralised zone was consistently traceable through all drillholes utilised in the Mineral Resource modelling.

Desert Gold and Minxcon have both reviewed the historical data, as well as validated drillhole collars in the field. Desert Gold further validated the historical drilling methods utilised by Hyundai by conducting their own follow up 2012 twinning drilling campaign. Good agreement has been found between the historical datasets and the 2012 drilling programme, thus validating the historical Hyundai data. When considering the volume of confirmatory drilling conducted in 2012 with respect to the mineralised envelope, a total of 26.6 % of all mineralised intersections was tested. This percentage is far above the accepted industry practice of 10% twinning. Minxcon is in agreement with Desert Gold that RC drilling provided adequate exploration results for the purposes of conducting a Mineral Resource estimate and that the historical Hyundai data is acceptable for utilisation in the same process.

Relative Density measurements, though sparse, are considered valid and have been utilised in the 2015 Mineral Resource estimate. Uncertainty may exist as to RD at depth, with current densities possibly being underestimated below 150 m depth due to the lack RD measurements below this depth. Current data supports an RD of 1.6 kg/dm³ down to a depth of 78 m and 1.7 kg/dm³ below this.

Item 10 (c) – EXPLORATION PROPERTIES – DRILLHOLE DETAILS
The current Mineral Resource is focussed on the Barani East target area. Barani East is typical of an advanced exploration property; drilling details have however been included in this section. Table 4 details the collar positions (easting, northing and elevation) as well as the end-of-hole (“EOH”) depth, drilled azimuth and dip for each of the holes drilled on the Barani East target area.

In general all drillholes were drilled at an approximate inclination of 60° to the west, while the mineralised zone has been interpreted to dip to the east at approximately 60°. This results in a net correction factor of approximately 0.87 which is required to correct the sample widths within the Barani Dataset. The true widths are not presented above in Table 4 due to the fact that the mineralisation does not follow a stratum and is not directly associated to a specific identified structural zone. However, during the modelling process, automatic thickness corrections are undertaken due to constraining wireframes.
An IP survey was carried out over target areas identified by other geophysical and geochemical surveys in the Barani East area. A total of 15 anomalies were identified and interpreted to indicate the presence of disseminated sulphides. As can be seen in Table 6, this interpretation was correct and the RC drilling during Phase 1 (2001-2002, Hyundai) did intersect significant zones with grades above 0.5 g/t cut-off (Desert Gold media release, February 2012).

Utilising the Phase 1 drilling information for Barani East collected by Hyundai, Desert Gold produced a geological map showing the grade distribution along the mineralised zone (Figure 31).

Desert Gold reported the following intersections and associated grades after their Phase 3 drilling at Barani East (Desert Gold press release, 23 April 2013):-
 BERC12-002: 7.81g/t au from 17 m to 30 m. Estimated true width of 11.5 m;  BERC12-003: 8.40g/t au from 26 m to 36 m. Estimated true width of 8 m; and  BERC12-005: 3.54g/t au from 1 m to 9 m. Estimated true width of 7 m.

Item 10 (d) – EXPLORATION POTENTIAL
Regionally, the Farabantourou license area is prospective due to the fact that it lies within a suite of Birimian lithologies known as the Kédougou-Kéniéba Inlier in which a number of operating mines can be found (Figure 28). As stated before, the most prominent regional structure in the area is considered to be the first‐order SMFZ running from the north-northeast to south-southwest through the property (Figure 37).

The area under investigation has undergone a series of exploration programmes, commencing in 1998 (by Hyundai Mali S.A.). Currently, Desert Gold is conducting exploration programmes which include interpretation of satellite imagery and RC and diamond drilling of identified soil geochemistry and geophysical targets. Airborne magnetic and spectrometric surveys have been conducted over the entire Project Area and soil geochemistry and IP surveys were carried out over identified targets (Barani, Barani East, Keniegoulou, Dambamba, Kousilli and Linnguekoto).

The targets were drilled in three phases: first general target drilling by RC followed by RC drilling focussed on Kousilli and, lastly, infill RC and diamond core drilling on Barani East.

A resource estimate was compiled by Resource Services Group from a portion of the first phase of drilling, in 2001, down to a depth 250 m over the Barani Prospect Area. This resource is JORC-compliant (Body, 2004). In 2013, Minxcon was commissioned to independently estimate and update the Mineral Resource Estimate for the Barani East Prospect within the Farabantourou License Area.

From the preceding discussion it is clear that exploration was conducted up to a Mineral Resource estimation level in only one of the six target areas, namely Barani East. Comparing the work completed with the residual magnetic anomalies, as shown in Figure 46, it may be observed that the bulk of the drilling was aimed at the low (blue) anomalies around Barani and between Kousilli and Keniegoulou. The resistivity work interpretation at Kousilli was coupled with the contours of the geochemistry anomalies and incorporated in the target generation for the second phase of drilling.

Total spectrometry surveys completed over the entire Farabantourou licence area (Figure 47) show anomalies around Barani and Barani East, as well as around Linnguekoto in the south. Of these, only the Barani targets have been drilled. IP work across the Barani, Dambamba and Keniegoulou areas has enabled higher resolution mapping and interpretation of the structures over the license area as shown in Figure 47.
The results from the drilling at Barani and Barani East showed that the mineralisation is, as anticipated, associated with the major shear zone and its resultant conjugate sets. The drilling results also highlight the fact that the mineralisation is not homogeneously distributed along the strike or dip of any of the lineaments. Body (2004) concludes that the results of the drilling show that gold mineralisation does occur but is inconclusive as to the prospectivity of the area.

It is likely that the zones of mineralisation in the Farabantourou license area will be long and thin in geometry, sporadically mineralised and have strikes of a few hundred meters up to ±3 km in length along regional structural trends, such as that of the Barani East occurrence. The Barani East occurrence may be used as a base case in order to ascertain the exploration potential of other areas within the Farabantourou license area. Based on this, a target zone of at least 750 m in length and exhibiting relatively continuous mineralisation between 5 m and 15 m in width, along strike, should be sought. The initial three phases of drilling on the Farabantourou license area were drilled with similar mineralised zone geometry in mind. The results have indicated that although mineralisation might be intersected in numerous places, the mineralisation is thin and isolated and the continuity of grade is very erratic.
Even so, there are still areas within the Farabantourou license area that could be considered to have exploration potential and that could be tested for a wider and more continuous mineralisation zone. The exploration potential may be outlined as follows (with the target areas depicted in Figure 48):-
a. Barani East There is the possibility to further define the resource by exploring along the strike extension of the interpreted fault, to the northeast, increasing the potential overall strike to roughly 3 km. It is recommended that a further two sets of fence drilling be carried out by means of RC drilling at 500 m traverse spacing along the northeast strike extent.
b. Keniegoulou The possibility of extending the target along strike to approximately 2 km exists as the first 14 lines of drilling have all intersected mineralisation and a north-northwest to south-southeast trend is observed along an interpreted fault. It is recommended that the trend be tested further by fence

72

drilling (RC) spaced at 500 m along the strike of the interpreted fault to the south. The holes should target the same depth (150 m) as the existing drilling. c. Dambamba It is possible to increase the overall target strike extent to 2.5 km by additional fence (RC) drilling in 500 m steps, down to 150 m in depth, to the south along the interpreted fault line as it is postulated. d. Kousilli The current drilling in this area intersected some mineralisation in only two of the four fence lines. If the drilling is overlain by the geochemistry anomalies, as well as the structural interpretation from the IP resistivity work, two northeast to southwest trending targets can be postulated. Drilling these targets on 500 m spaced fence lines stepped out from the existing lines might intersect wider and more continuous mineralisation zones. e. Kousilli (South) Some geochemical anomalies have been reported in this area. It is recommended that a small fence drilling programme is undertaken to test the potential within these anomalies. f. Linnguekoto The existing drilling tested a 2 km strike extent along a postulated lineament with very little success. The mineralisation is very unevenly distributed and present in very narrow intersections. It is, therefore, not promoted as a target. g. Linnguekoto (West) The 10 RC holes drilled in this prospect did not intersect any mineralisation, however, the fault structure, as interpreted and displayed in Figure 48, could be considered an exploration target, especially as it runs nearly on the contact between a “high” and a “low” total spectrum anomaly, similar to the setting of the proposed Barani East extension target. It is recommended that a programme of soil geochemistry coupled with an IP survey is undertaken over the area. The targets generated by this work may then be tested by drilling.

ITEM 11 – SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

74

The following section pertains to the 2012 Desert Gold confirmatory twinning drillhole program only. Historical data pertaining to the pre-2012 sample preparation, analysis and security is not available, hence reliance is placed on the 2012 data in order to validate the historical data.
Item 11 (a) SAMPLE HANDLING PRIOR TO DISPATCH
Minxcon did not review the sample preparation, analysis or security whilst the drilling and sampling programme of 2012 was underway. Minxcon depends on information provided by Desert Gold/TransAfrika and Coffey, who managed the QA/QC, in order to reach an objective assessment. Minxcon did, however, review the assay data in conjunction with the QA/QC Report on the drilling programme, as provided by Coffey to Desert Gold (McKinney, January 2013) and is in agreement that the data may be used for the purposes of Mineral Resource estimation.
With respect to the diamond drillholes of 2012, from the information provided, all sample preparation and quality control measures were conducted by the analytical laboratory. No pre-dispatch sample preparation was undertaken on the diamond drillholes. The insertion of QA/QC samples in the form of Standard Reference Materials (“SRMs”), blanks and blind repeats, was however routinely conducted and reviewed by Coffey.
The RC holes (2012 Desert Gold drilling programme) were sampled in 1 m intervals and riffle split in the field prior to despatch to the laboratory. QA/QC samples were also inserted in the field prior to despatch, in the form of SRMs, blanks and blind repeats and field duplicates from the split samples.
Item 11 (b) – SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS PROCEDURES
Minxcon was not able to review the sample preparation, analysis or security for the pre-2012 data during the tenure by Hyundai, as this information no longer exists. However the twinning programme procedures and the agreement between results from the recent and historical programs attest to the validity of the historical assay data.
The RC and diamond drill sample preparation and analysis for the 2012 drilling programme was carried out by ALS Chemex, Bamako, Mali. ALS is part of an international group which operates laboratory facilities throughout the world. ALS Chemex in Bamako has no accreditation but operates with the same protocols as other accredited laboratories in the ALS group. ALS is independent of both TransAfrika and Coffey.
Core samples were split into half core using a core cutter. One half of the core was sent for analysis and the second half was retained at the storage facilities at Kéniéba. RC samples were split on site using a riffle splitter to obtain at 4 kg sample for assay. A duplicate sample was taken as reference material for each sample and is stored in secured storage in Kéniéba; the remainder of the sample was discarded. All halfcore samples were sealed in calico bags with a unique sample number. The samples were then placed in a poly-woven bag. In both cases the total sample, as sent to the laboratory, was crushed and pulverised to achieve 85% of the sample at less than 75 µm. Firstly, a Primary Crush to less than 2 mm was conducted with a target of 90% required to pass below this limit. Pulverising of the crushed material, required 85% material to pass at less than 75 µm. For the Primary Crusher, 1 in every 50 samples was checked for compliance by means of a sieve test. All samples were analysed for Au by fire assay with an AAS finish. The detection limit for this method of gold analysis with 50 g sample by fire assay is 0.01 ppm Au.
Item 11 (c) – QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL
Minxcon was not able to review historical QA/QC that might have been conducted by Hyundai, as this information was lost, prior to the Desert Gold take-over.

Minxcon was not able to observe the QA/QC process in action for the 2012 drilling programme, however, a QA/QC report submitted by Coffey was reviewed. In Minxcon’s opinion, the extent of QA/QC employed is reasonable and in line with industry practice (Mckinney, 2013). A comprehensive QA/QC programme was undertaken. It was possible to identify samples that had been swapped, that were missing, and that were incorrectly labelled, amongst others.

Sampling was undertaken and quality control was monitored by Coffey Mining; an independent geological consultant. Standard procedures commonly used in West African gold exploration programmes were followed. Samples were dispatched in sealed bags to the laboratories. The quality control program was to include a standard and a duplicate within every 20 samples submitted. During the RC drilling programmes a blank was also inserted within every 20 samples. The intended aim was 5% coverage for each of the control sample types. This was not strictly adhered to due to operating difficulties during parts of the various sampling programmes, but sufficient quality control samples were submitted to demonstrate the accuracy and precision achieved by the laboratories.

The quality control data was analysed on an on-going basis and generated queries with the laboratory. While most data problems were successfully resolved there are a number of analyses, especially in low grade SRMs which produced results outside of expected ranges. These have not been explained and may be random errors due to a variety of causes. The presence of a large number of apparently random errors reduces the confidence in the data, however, the data is still of sufficient quality to be used for target generation exercises.

Terms related to the QA/QC protocols applied and subsequent evaluations are provided in the following:A standard is a reference sample with a known (statistically) element abundance and standard deviation. Reference standards are used to gauge the accuracy of analytical reporting by comparing the predetermined values to those reported by the laboratory used during an exploration project.

A blank is a standard with abundance of the element of interest below the level of detection of the analytical technique. A duplicate is the split of a sample taken at a particular stage of the sampling process, e.g. a field duplicate. The precision and accuracy are discussed in terms of the following statistical measures routinely applied by Coffey:-
 Thompson and Howarth Plot showing the mean relative percentage error of grouped assay pairs across the entire grade range, used to visualise precision levels by comparing against given control lines.
 Rank HARD Plot, which ranks all assay pairs in terms of precision levels measured as half of the absolute relative difference from the mean of the assay pairs (“HARD”), used to visualise relative precision levels and to determine the percentage of the assay pairs’ population occurring at a certain precision level.
 Mean vs. HARD Plot, used as another way of illustrating relative precision levels by showing the range of HARD over the grade range.
 Mean vs. BIRD Plot is similar to the previous plot, but the sign is retained, thus allowing negative or positive differences to be computed. This plot gives an overall impression of precision and also shows whether or not there is a significant bias between the assay pairs by illustrating the mean percent half relative difference between the assay pairs (mean HRD).
 Correlation Plot is a simple plot of the value of assay 1 against assay 2. This plot allows an overall visualisation of precision and bias over selected grade ranges. Correlation coefficients are also used.
 Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) Plot is a means where the marginal distributions of two datasets can be compared. Similar distributions should be noted if the data is unbiased.

For field soil duplicates a second sample was taken in the field from the same drillhole as the original sample. For field drilling samples an empty sample bag with a sample ticket was submitted for the laboratory

to split the previous sample after crushing during sample preparation. Eight standards of high and low grades were used at different times in the programmes depending on availability. All standards were supplied by Geostats (Pty) Ltd, Australia. Locally-bought building sand was used as the blank material.

Item 11 (d) – ADEQUACY OF SAMPLE PREPARATION
Minxcon reviewed the preparation parameters from ALS Laboratory, which are in line with international standards, which require the Primary Crusher to be less than 2 mm (90% to be achieved to be compliant). Pulverising to less than 75 µm (85% to be achieved to be compliant). For the Primary Crusher, 1 in every 50 samples was checked for compliance by means of a sieve test. For the pulverising to less than 75 µm, it appears that between I in 25 to 1 in 30 samples were checked (by sieving) by the laboratory to determine if it reached the required fineness.

ITEM 12 – DATA VERIFICATION

77

Item 12 (a) – DATA VERIFICATION PROCEDURES
Subsequent to the 2012 drilling programme conducted by Desert Gold, Mr Louw van Schalkwyk (VP Exploration and Director for Desert Gold at the time) conducted a review of the historical drilling data (172 drillholes were drilled by means of RC drilling on Barani East by Hyundai) versus the data obtained during the 2012 programme in order to test the TransAfrika and Coffey hypothesis that the historical data was not acceptable with respect to collar surveys and data quality.
The 2012 drilling campaign consisted of 12 RC drillholes and 5 diamond drillholes which were positioned with the purposes of twinning some of the historical Hyundai drillholes to test repeatability of drilling results. and also to compare the assay results from diamond drilling versus RC drilling. The 17 Desert Gold holes were drilled to intersect the mineralised zone. The 17 holes represent some 26.6% duplication or testing of drilling originally conducted by Hyundai to pass through the mineralised zone. This is far above the accepted industrial norm of 10%. Review of the QA/QC report generated by Coffey, as well as reference to printed sections indicating downhole orientations and sampling were utilised for the verification of existing holes utilised in the 2013 estimate and these sections were also used for the verification of the surrounding additional drillholes.
Review of the data and drilling methods by Mr Louw van Schalkwyk (VP Exploration and Director for Desert Gold at the time) after the completion of the 2012 drilling programme provided a basis for validating data quality generated by Hyundai. Desert Gold conducted a review of the collar coordinates of some of the historical drillhole collars relative to the new holes and selected 79 of these which they were able to validate for the 2013 Mineral Resource estimate. During the QP’s site visit the location, azimuth and dip of 25° of these drillholes were confirmed.
Of the 172 drillholes, 79 were used in the 2013 Mineral Resource estimation and geological modelling over the most prospective area at Barani East. Out of the 79 drillholes interpreted to intersect the mineralised zone, only 64 had verifiable assay data falling within the mineralised envelope, while the balance were utilised for the geological modelling only outside the mineralised envelope. In 2015, Minxcon assisted Desert Gold by conducting a data capture exercise of outstanding drillhole data surrounding the core mineralised area (from the 1998 to 2003 Hyundai drilling programs) in order to confirm and assist with better delineation of the original identified mineralised zone, as well as to identify additional exploration targets which were not discernible in 2013. 107 drillholes from Barani East and 42 drillholes from Barani were added to the 2013 database of 79 drillholes, thus rendering a total dataset of 228 drillholes.
Of the 228 total drillholes, only 64 drillholes were interpreted to intersect the mineralised zone, of which only 64 had verifiable assay values. This means that no additional drillholes were utilised in the 2015 Mineral Resource estimate for the mineralised zone, however the additional holes served to tighten up on the mineralised envelope geometry and to prove, or validate the strike extent of the mineralised zone. Of the additional drillholes added in 2015, 31 constituted mineralised intersections and were used to identify additional exploration targets, of which only 26 were utilised in the updated Mineral Resource estimate due to assay data validation shortcomings on 5 of the drillholes.
During the Site visit conducted by the QP (Mr Uwe Engelmann), some historical collars (historically plugged in the field with a concrete plug with drillhole details inscribed on the concrete (refer to Figure 14) were checked relative to the 17 drillholes generated during the 2012 drilling campaign. Good agreement was found between the historical datasets and the 2012 drilling programme, thus Minxcon deemed the locations of the collar positions to be sufficiently accurate and reliable for resource estimation purposes.

78

Subsequent to the site visit, Minxcon conducted a review of the 2012 drillholes versus the historical data to verify the Desert Gold inference of mineralisation continuity between RC and diamond drillholes by means of plotting the different datasets in section view. The results definitely indicate mineralisation continuity between the 2012 drilling campaign and the historical data. Thus, Minxcon is in agreement with Desert Gold that RC drilling provided adequate exploration results for the purposes of conducting a Mineral Resource estimate, thus negating the view originally held by TransAfrika and Coffey that the historical data was unacceptable, especially in light of the fact that Coffey signed-off the 2012 drilling campaign and attested to the quality of the 2012 RC drilling data obtained.

An example of one of sections reviewed is presented below in Figure 49.

Minxcon reviewed the RD measurements undertaken by Desert Gold in 2012. The data, though sparse, are considered valid and have been utilised in the 2015 Mineral Resource estimate. Uncertainty may exist as to RD at depth, with current densities possibly being underestimated below 150 m depth due to the lack of RD measurements below this depth. Current data supports an RD of 1.6 kg/dm³ down to a depth of 78 m and 1.7 kg/dm³ below this.
The additional (Hyundai 2001 – 2002) data was provided upon advice of Minxcon in order to ensure full disclosure of all relevant exploration results as well as to test for strike extension of the main mineralised zone identified in previous estimates.

DRILLHOLE DATASET FOR PREVIOUS MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES Minxcon firstly validated all of the individual drillhole input files of the original dataset. Collar files were checked to ensure that all the drillholes fit with the Project perimeter. Surveys were then checked to ensure all surveys were pointing down in the correct layout direction. This was checked by referring to an index plan provided by the Client. Lithology files were checked for gaps and overlaps, as were the drillhole assay files. All drillholes were checked to ensure that all five of the data sets were available: collars, survey, lithology, assay and RD. Minxcon found a few errors and some missing data entries. Desert Gold assisted to correct these problems before the modelling drillhole files were consolidated, imported and desurveyed in Datamine Studio.

ADDITIONAL DRILLHOLE DATASET FOR 2015 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES Minxcon firstly captured the .pdf collars and sampling intervals and downhole survey information in MS Excel worksheets. The captured drillhole collars were then validated relative to the WGS84 coordinate system utilised in the historical estimates, as no statement was made in historical documentation as to the coordinate system utilised by Hyundai. It was found that a constant lateral shift of approximately 325 m existed between the previous estimated data and the additional collar data. Collar elevations between these two datasets however showed very little variance. Minxcon then conducted a bulk shift of the captured collars relative to the historically estimated drillholes in order to correct the apparent shift and compared the collar positions relative to the topography as well as to historical drillhole plans. In addition, the QP conducted a check in the field on some of these captured drillholes in order to serve as a further validation check on the drillhole positions and found that the shifted coordinates were within acceptable limits.
Minxcon is of the opinion that all collar data as occurring in the current updated 2015 dataset have been captured to acceptable limits. The downhole azimuth data was captured from and was visually validated on desurveying. Two geologists captured the available assay data in the downhole sections. These captured assay results were then validated for gaps and overlaps, as well as checked for typographical errors. Drillholes where assay results could not be read were excluded from the estimation database, but the mineralised interval (sans assay value) was utilised in the generation of the mineralisation wireframes, where applicable. The two drillhole datasets were then added to create the final drillhole dataset utilised in the 2015 Mineral Resource estimate. A plot of the resultant complete dataset is plotted below in Figure 50.

Item 12 (b) – LIMITATIONS ON/FAILURE TO CONDUCT DATA VERIFICATION
Minxcon physically checked the collars of 25 of the drillholes in the field during their site visit. Minxcon was unable to observe the logging or sampling practices employed by TransAfrika and Coffey, as the drilling programme was completed before Minxcon was approached by the client to conduct the modelling exercise. Minxcon did, however, review the assay certificates presented by the laboratory, as well as the final QA/QC report produced by Coffey Mining in 2013.
Item 12 (c) – ADEQUACY OF DATA
Minxcon is of the opinion that the data utilised in the geological modelling and Mineral Resource Estimation exercise is adequate for the purposes of generating an Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource. Drillholes were spaced in 50 m by 25 m grids within the main mineralised area of the mineralised zone. This is in line with normal, close-spaced drilling programmes for the generation of compliant Mineral Resources in accordance with the requirements embodied within NI 43-101. The drillhole spacing does in actual fact lend itself to a possible Measured Resource (based on geostatistical parameters) of approximately 126,000 t, which equates to 23% of the tonnage and 29% of the ounces attributable to the Indicated Mineral Resource. The Mineral Resource has, however, not been declared as such because of the historical nature of the bulk of the data.

At this juncture it should be noted that Desert Gold conducted a considerable volume of confirmatory twin drilling in 2012 with respect to the mineralised envelope. A total of 26.6% of all mineralised intersections was tested for the purposes of QA/QC of the historical Hyundai data. This percentage is far above the accepted industry practice of 10% twinning. Results from the twinning study, as well as the assay QA/QC results for the 2012 drilling programme serve to justify the use of the historical Hyundai data for the purposes of Mineral Resource estimation.

 Composite of BEDD12-001 and BEDD12-002 (“composite 1”); and  Composite of BEDD12-004 and BEDD12-005 (“composite 2”).
The following tests were conducted: Testwork to determine amenability to gravity recovery;  Grading analysis to determine gold distribution across size fractions;  Heavy liquid separation to determine the amount of free gold or gold in heavy particles;  Exposure and mineral association analysis of the particulate gold grains in the gravity concentrate;  Chemical analysis to determine the compositions of the mineralised material and metallurgical test products;  General mineralogical characterisation of the mineralised material;  Identification and quantification of the gold minerals in the gravity concentrate;  Grain size distribution of the gold grains in the gravity concentrate; and  Testwork to determine the gold recovery by direct cyanidation.
The results are summarised as follows: The average head grade for the samples was 2.86 g/t and 2.62 g/t for composites 1 and 2 respectively.  Heavy liquid separation at an SG of 2.96 showed that, on average, about 20% and 19% of the gold was lost to the -25 µm fraction for composite 1 and 2 respectively. About 28% and 16% reported to the floats fractions for the composite samples respectively. The remaining 52% and 65% reported as sinks.  Knelson concentration of composites 1 and 2 yielded recoveries of 43% and 46% respectively.  Each composite was milled to 80% passing 75 µm. Normal cyanide leaching of the samples yielded recoveries of 94% for both composites, while intense leaching yielded recoveries of 97% and 92% respectively after 24 hours.  Preg robbing was not detected.
Peacocke Simpson Testwork A 2 tonne bulk sample was collected from the Barani East Gold Prospect Area and was tested for gravity and cyanide leaching amenability by Peacocke Simpson laboratories. The tests were completed in Harare, Zimbabwe and a report was submitted in March 2014 (report number PSA/33/14) summarising the findings.
The following tests were conducted: Scrubbing and semi-batch Knelson gravity concentration;  Bulk Continuous Variable-Discharge (“CVD”) Knelson concentration on gravity semi-batch Knelson tails;  Spiral concentration of CVD concentrate;  Intense cyanide leaching of spiral concentrate; and  Normal cyanide leaching of CVD tails.

Result 40.3% gold recovery was achieved on the minus 2 mm material Mass pull of 11.2% at a recovery of 46.1% Mass pull of 21.6% at recovery of 61.8% gold Gold recovery of 93.4% after 24 hours Gold recovery of 55% after 24 hours

Based on this testwork, the following processing steps were envisaged: Scrubbing of RoM material;  Crushing of scrubber oversize with the product recycled to scrubber;  Semi-batch Knelson processing of scrubber undersize;  CVD Knelson and spirals processing of semi-batch tails;  High-intensity leaching of CVD/spiral concentrate; and  Deposition of CVD/spiral and high intensity leach tails onto a dedicated tailings storage facility (“TSF”).

It was also assumed that the sample taken for the above testwork was representative of the entire mined resource. If this is not the case then processing performance may vary.

Item 13 (b) – BASIS OF ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING RECOVERY ESTIMATES
Milling would be too costly and since SGS milled the samples before cyanidation tests their results would not be applicable to the initial phase of the Barani East Project.

The process flow methodology and estimated plant design recovery was therefore based on the Peacocke Simpson testwork conducted in March 2014 (report number PSA/33/14). A total recovery of 65% was estimated:-
 About 40% with a semi-batch Knelson;  About 46% with a CVD Knelson on the semi-batch tails; and  About 93% on the CVD Knelson concentrate – spirals would serve to further upgrade the CVD
concentrate if required.

Item 13 (c) – REPRESENTATIVENESS OF SAMPLES
The following samples were taken from the Barani East Prospect and analysed by SGS and Peacocke Simpson: A 2 tonne surface bulk sample; and  SG-analysed drill core samples.

Because these two sets of samples achieved similar gravity recoveries it is assumed that together these samples are representative of the mineralised zone in terms of gravity gold recovery additional samples may however be required to improve the confidence of these samples.

Item 13 (d) – DELETERIOUS ELEMENTS FOR EXTRACTION
The high-intensity leach circuit tails will be pumped to a separate TSF that will be lined due to possibility for high-cyanide concentrations. No other deleterious elements are expected.

ITEM 14 – MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES

85

The Mineral Resources were compiled by Qualified Persons, in compliance with the definitions and guidelines for the reporting of Exploration Information, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves in Canada, “the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves – Definitions and Guidelines” and in accordance with the Rules and Policies of the NI 43-101.
Item 14 (a) – ASSUMPTIONS, PARAMETERS AND METHODS USED FOR RESOURCE ESTIMATES
The bulk of this Section is a summary of the geostatistical estimation undertaken by Minxcon.
Minxcon was appointed to undertake the compilation of the gold geostatistical models for the Barani East Project. Following an investigation and analysis of the assay procedures and data integrity, gold estimation models were compiled. Minxcon undertook the classification of the gold Mineral Resources. The overall aim of the geostatistical modelling was to generate a block model, using the data supplied by Desert Gold/TransAfrika, and to classify the Mineral Resource.
For Barani East, 3D wireframes were constructed from drillhole information representing the mineralised zone in 3D space. The wireframes were filled with block models of various sizes. Sample lengths averaged ~ 1.0 m, and were composited to 1.0 m lengths for utilisation in grade estimation. Wireframes were generated for the mineralised zone based on a 0.3 g/t composite. Zones of mineralization were modelled into a main zone and additional hanging wall and footwall zones. The ferricrete base was used as an erosive contact to terminate the mineralised zone.
Statistical analysis provided a basis for final data verification and was used to establish specific information on population distributions and checks for anomalous values. Spatial continuity illustrations (variograms) were constructed for gold. Simple Kriging methodologies were utilised for the evaluation of the mineralised zones, in the main zone and footwall and hanging wall zones in accordance with the spacing and density of the data and Kriging efficiency.
Statistical Analysis A statistical analysis of the gold values was carried out on the data as a single population and in the lenses that were created in the geological modelling process. These results are given in Table 8, Due to the lack of population data for the lenses, these values were then included into a total population and statistics was carried out on a whole population instead.

Histograms were created to develop an understanding of the sample population distribution relationships. Probability plots were used to evaluate the normality of the distribution of the variables estimated.
Figure 52 represents the Histogram for the Main zone and combined Main and Hanging wall and Footwall zones. The data shows a typical log normal distribution of the Au values, which is expected for this type of deposit.

Top-Cutting Strategy The statistical analysis of the normal and log probability plots for each mineralised zone was conducted as well as the combined dataset. The top-cutting in the variography stage is intended to limit the excessive variances of the anomalously high grade from skewing the distribution away from the representative variance of the data distribution. After analysis it was regarded that although there are some high values they do not represent a deviation from the population, as can be seen in the probability plots in Figure 53, and have thus been considered as representative for the purposes of Mineral Resource estimation. For this reason no top-cutting has been applied in this estimation as this would unfairly and unjustifiably discount the mineralised zone.
Variography Variograms are an essential tool for investigating the spatial relationships of samples. Variograms for gold grade were modelled. Anisotropy for gold within the mineralised zone was investigated, although all the variograms are deemed best represented by anisotropic models. Variograms were calculated and modelled in the plane of the mineralised zone and in direction of dip. The experimental variograms were created using the Main zone mineralised data set.
In Figure 54, the Variogram in the long axis with the experimental variogram of the Main zone is shown with the variogram ranges. The short range was set to be 39 m and the long range was set to 137 m. The

intermediate range, or strike range was 103 m. Although the range in the variogram is seen to be 139 m for the estimation, a shorter search range of 69m was use to restrict the estimation beyond the informed data.

Domaining Methodology The domains were defined by geological wireframes, namely: the base of the ferricrete and the mineralised zones. Due to the nature of the deposit, no lithological boundary could be used to define domains and only mineralised zones could be defined based on a sampled 0.3 g/t grade limit. The mineralised zones in the form of the main, hanging wall and footwall mineralised zones were identified and are depicted in Figure 55. Minxcon decided that a single domain for the mineralised zone be used and the ferricrete zone be deemed to be barren and thus not estimated.

Volume/Tonnage Calculation The RD value of 1.6 kg/dm³ was used for the area from surface to 78 m below and an Rd of 1,7 kg/dm³ was used for the area from 78 m to the base of the estimation of 240 m below surface.

Estimation Techniques The modelling was undertaken on gold grade (g/t); the drillhole data was composited to 1 m. Modelling was carried out using Datamine Studio™. Kriging was undertaken as the accuracy and efficiency of the kriged estimates can be tested, unlike other conventional estimation techniques such as nearest neighbour which have limited verification parameters. Ordinary Kriging (“OK”) and Simple Kriging (“SK”) were conducted for the estimation of the gold grades for each of the mineralised zones. SK was used to compile the final estimation models as the Kriging efficiencies utilising OK were deemed to be unacceptable as negative kriging efficiencies were generated.

The Table 9 below is a summary of the Variogram utilised for grade estimation The search parameters used in the Mineral Resource estimation exercise are presented in Table 10. A cell size of 20 m x 20 m x 4 m with sub cell splitting was employed for the estimation as this gave the best Kriging efficiency. The Block model was created using the wireframes boundaries and only estimations into these boundaries was carried out. The block model parameters utilised in the Mineral Resource estimate for Barani East are presented below in Table 11.

Basis of Mineral Resource Classification
The Mineral Resources were classified in accordance with the NI 43-101 Code. The Code allows for the reporting of all potentially economic mineralised material, which includes dams and tailings (remnant material), where there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
The Mineral Resource classification is a function of the confidence of the whole process from drilling, sampling, geological understanding and geostatistical relationships The following aspects or parameters were used for Mineral Resource classification:-

Mineral Resource Cut-Off The Mineral Resource is stated at a cut-off of 0.5 g/t Au. The cut-off was determined using a gold price based on the historical real term commodity price since 1980 and applying the 85% percentile to this graph. The 85% percentile of this graph is USD1,320/oz. Open pit operating costs, mining factors and processing factors (heap leach) were also applied. Parameters as per Table 13 were applied to compute the Mineral Resource cut-off value:-

The mining cost assumption for the resource cut-off calculation is based on contractor rates calculated and/or estimated for a Feasibility Study completed middle 2015 for a coal project in Tanzania which will be a free dig operation for the overburden. The mining costs, for the free dig portion, for the envisaged free dig operation at Barani East are therefore assumed to be similar to the free dig operation at the afore mentioned project. The drill and blast mining cost of USD2.20/t is in line with the industry mining cost.

The following assumptions were made:-

60% Free Dig Material 40% Drill & Blast Total Mining Rate

Rate

USD1.70/t x 0.6 USD2.20/t x 0.4 USD1.90/t mined

The processing figure is based on an in house scoping study completed on a similar type Gold Project (with a production rate of 50,000 tpm) in Tanzania, located in the Lake Victoria Goldfields which is broadly similar to other gold producing Archaean greenstone terranes. Since both projects are located in Africa and are both in greenstone domains it was assumed that the processing costs would be similar. The table below details the parameters that were utilised in that specific project.

A pit optimisation (NPV Scheduler) was run on the resource model. The parameters used in the run are: Mining costs (USD1.90/t);  Treatment costs (USD7.5/t);  Commodity price (USD1320/oz);  Mining rate of 25 ktpm; and  Recovery of 75%.

The resulting optimised pit shell for the Barani East project can be seen in Figure 58 and Figure 59. The NPV Scheduler optimises the pit at a maximum depth of 160 m (Figure 59). However, the pit could be mined to a greater depth, but this would not be optimal. The maximum model depth is approximately 190 m (associated drillholes can be seen in Figure 57) and for this reason no depth cut off has been applied to the resource model as it could be mined deeper than the optimum 160 m.

Item 14 (b) – DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR RESOURCES
All Mineral Resources have been categorised and reported in compliance with the definitions embodied in the CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted by the CIM Council (incorporated into NI 43-101) and the SAMREC Code. As per CIM and SAMREC Code specifications, Mineral Resources have been reported separately in the Measured, Indicated and Inferred categories. Inferred Mineral Resources have been reported separately and have not been incorporated with the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources.
Item 14 (c) – INDIVIDUAL GRADE OF METALS
Mineral Resources for gold have been estimated for the Barani East Project, as detailed in Item 14 (a). No other metals or minerals have been estimated for the Project.
Item 14 (d) – FACTORS AFFECTING MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES
Minxcon is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, marketing, political modifying factors that might have a bearing on the Mineral Resources estimate for the Barani East Project. During the QP’s site visit, two abandoned artisanal shafts were encountered on the property, however no illegal mining is currently taking place. In the unlikely event that significant artisanal activity does take place, the Mineral Resource could possibly be socio-economically negatively impacted. This risk has however not been quantified.

Item 16 (a) – PUBLIC DOMAIN INFORMATION
The Barani East Gold Prospect occurs on the Desert Gold's Farabantourou permit located in Western Mali. The permit falls on the SMFZ, 40 km south of Sadiola Mine and 50 km north of the Loulo-Gounkoto mine complex. Both these mines are located on the SMFZ. The location of these mines relative to Barani East Prospect is indicated in Figure 60.
Figure 60: Mines Nearby to Barani East Prospect

Mines Nearby to Barani East Prospect

November 2015 Datum: WGS84

The Sadiola deposit has been intensely weathered to depths of up to 220 m. The operation has mainly exploited soft oxide ore since start-up with the current known oxide reserves expected to be mined out by 2016. A significant mineral resource of hard sulphide ore occurs below the final Sadiola pit design and is currently the target of an expansion project pending final approvals. The Sadiola Gold Mine is operated by AGA. Mining is carried out using conventional open pit techniques with a carbon-in-pulp processing plant. There are currently five open pits.
The Loulo and Gounkoto mines, known as the Loulo-Gounkoto complex, are located in the west of Mali, bordering Senegal and adjacent to the Falémé River. Production from open pit operations started at Loulo in 2005. This was followed by the development of the underground mines. Gounkoto, a greenfields discovery in 2009, poured its first gold in June 2011. The ore from Gounkoto is processed by the Loulo plant under a tolling agreement. Based on current reserves, the complex has a scheduled LoM to 2027.

ITEM 17 – OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

102

Item 17 (a) - UPSIDE POTENTIAL
Strike extension for the Barani East Prospect appears limited due to the drilling both north and south of the current identified mineralised zone. Potential exists with respect to dip extension of the mineralised zone, but the upside potential in this regard is limited by economical mining limits.
Upside potential around Barani East exists in the interpreted exploration targets in the hanging wall located northeast of the current estimated mineralised zone (Figure 61). Data at this point is not sufficient for robust interpretation.
Figure 61: Hanging Wall Exploration Target Located to the Northeast of Barani East

Hanging Wall Exploration Target Located to the Northeast of Barani East

November 2015

Within the greater Farabantourou Permit Area, exploration potential exits in numerous areas namely: Keniegoulou, Dambamba, Kousilli, Kousilli (South), Linnguekoto, Linnguekoto (West). These prospects and their potential are discussed in Item 10 (d). Please refer to Figure 48 for the location of these prospective areas within Farabantourou.

ITEM 18 – INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

103

Minxcon has reviewed all the information and has made the following observations regarding the Farabantourou - Barani East Prospect:-
 Minxcon is of the opinion that the historical data on Barani East is acceptable in terms of collar survey and overall data quality after the site visit and after reviewing the drilling conducted during 2012.
 The main mineralised zone, a hanging wall and 2 footwall mineralised zones have been identified at Barani East, based upon a 0.3 g/t cut-off.
 The strike length of the orebody has increased from 650 m, to approximately 800 m due to the inclusion of the historical drilling to the north and south of the 2013 interpreted mineralised zone.
 Relative density data, though limited is of acceptable standard and is viewed as being representative of the host lithologies down to an approximate depth of 150 m below surface. Uncertainty exists below this limit. Minxcon revised the utilised RD down from 1.8 kg/dm³ to 1.6 kg/dm³ down to a depth of 78 m below surface and to 1.7 kg/dm³ below this.
 Exploration potential on Barani East is limited (except for the potential exploration hanging wall target), however on the greater Farabantourou Permit Area, 6 other exploration targets have been identified.
 Changes to the Mineral Resource are attributed to the change in RD applied during modelling, the adjusted modelled depth from a previous 250 m (based on a perceived optimised mining constraint) to a maximum depth of approximately 190 m (based on the geostatistical modelling of the drillhole data), and due to the additional historical data utilised in this Mineral Resource estimate, as well as the change in the capping strategy applied during 2015.

ITEM 19 – RECOMMENDATIONS

104

Minxcon recommends the following for the Farabantourou - Barani East Prospect:  Minxcon recommends that Desert Gold implements a recognised, industry standard database for all its historical exploration data on a central server for the purposes of data security and preservation.  It is recommended that Desert Gold do additional drilling around the potential exploration target identified in the hanging wall of the Barani prospect in order to possibly improve the resource.  Other areas where historical drilling has taken place should be identified and similar data verification exercises undertaken in order to maximise the Resource yield within the Farabantourou Permit area.  In the event of a preliminary economic assessment being successfully completed on the updated Mineral Resource, Minxcon recommends that additional infill drilling is undertaken to better delineate the mineralised zone prior to the commencement of mining.

Definition
A common type of geophysical survey carried out using a magnetometer aboard or towed behind an aircraft. Aeromagnetic surveys are widely used to aid in the production of geological maps and are also commonly used during mineral exploration and petroleum exploration The Archean Eon (also spelled Archaean) is a geologic eon, 4,000 to 2,500 million years ago, following the Hadean Eon and preceding the Proterozoic Eon. During the Archean, the earth's crust and layers had just formed making the Earth much cooler than it was during the Hadean, allowing the formation of continents.
An iron arsenic sulfide (FeAsS)
An artisanal miner or small-scale miner is, in effect, a subsistence miner. They are not officially employed by a mining company, but rather work independently, mining or panning for gold using their own resources. A facility in which the proportions of metal in ores or concentrates are determined using analytical techniques.
A synonym for gold-bearing.
Defined as a horizontal angle measured clockwise from any fixed reference plane or easily established base direction line The Birimian rocks are major sources of gold and diamonds that extend through Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali and Burkina Faso. They are named after the Birim River, one of the main tributaries of the Pra River in Ghana. The rocks formed over a period of about 50 million years between 2.200 Ga and 2.100 Ga years ago. In analytical chemistry, the detection limit, lower limit of detection, or LOD (limit of detection), is the lowest quantity of a substance that can be distinguished within a stated confidence limit. A blank has a value below the detection limit and is used to test for contamination during the sample preparation phase of assay A process similar to CIP (described below) except that the ore slurries are not leached with cyanide prior to carbon loading. Instead, the leaching and carbon loading occur simultaneously. A common process used to extract gold from cyanide leach slurries. The process consists of carbon granules suspended in the slurry and flowing counter-current to the process slurry in multiple-staged agitated tanks. The process slurry, which has been leached with cyanide prior to the CIP process, contains solubilised gold. The solubilised gold is absorbed onto the carbon granules, which are subsequently separated from the slurry by screening. The gold is then recovered from the carbon by electrowinning onto steel wool cathodes or by a similar process. A coarse-grained clastic sedimentary rock that is composed of a substantial fraction of rounded to subangular gravel-size clasts, e.g., granules, pebbles, cobbles, and boulders, larger than 2 mm (0.079 in) in diameter. A craton is an ancient part of the Earth's continental crust which has been more or less stable since Precambrian times. Cut-off grade is any grade that, for any specific reason, is used to separate two courses of action, e.g. to mine or to leave, to mill or to dump. An exploration drilling method, where the rock is cut with a diamond drilling bit, usually to extract core samples.
Waste which is mixed with ore in the mining process.
The angle that a structural surface, i.e. a bedding or fault plane, makes with the horizontal. It is measured perpendicular to the strike of the structure. is a type of later vertical rock between older layers of rock. Technically, it is any geologic body which cuts across: flat wall rock structures, such as bedding. massive rock formations, usually igneous in origin. The Eburnean orogeny, or Eburnean cycle was a series of tectonic, metamorphic and plutonic events in what is now West Africa during the Paleoproterozoic era between about 2200–2000 million years ago. During this period the Birimian domain in West Africa was established and structured.
Environmental Impact Assessment
Prospecting, sampling, mapping, diamond drilling and other work involved in the search for mineralisation. The features that characterise rock as having been emplaced, metamorphosed or deposited in a sedimentary fashion, under specific condition. In the case of sediment host deposits, this infers deposition within a particular depositional environment.
The process of fracturing that produces a displacement within, of across lithologies.
A definitive engineering estimate of all costs, revenues, equipment requirements and production levels likely to be achieved if a mine is developed. The study is used to define the economic viability of a project and to support the search for project financing.

Definition
Ferricrete is a hard, erosion-resistant layer of material at the land surface that consists of near surface sediments that have been cemented by iron oxide into a duricrust. Ferricretes contains sediments and other non-indigenous materials, which have been transported from outside the immediate area in which it occurs. The iron oxide cements are derived from the oxidation of percolating solutions of iron salts.
The underlying side of a fault, Mineral Deposit or stope.
A common and widely distributed type of rock formed by high-grade regional metamorphic processes from pre-existing formations that were originally either igneous or sedimentary rocks. The quantity of metal per unit mass of ore expressed as a percentage or, for gold, as grams per tonne of ore. A common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture. Granites can be predominantly white, pink, or gray in color, depending on their mineralogy. The word "granite" comes from the Latin granum, a grain, in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock. By definition, granite is an igneous rock with at least 20% quartz and up to 65% alkali feldspar by volume. Granulites are a class of high grade metamorphic rocks of the granulite-facies that have experienced high-temperature and moderate pressure metamorphism. They are medium to coarse–grained and mainly composed of feldspars sometimes associated with quartz and anhydrous ferromagnesian minerals, with granoblastic texture and gneissose to massive structure. Greenschist are metamorphic rocks that formed under the lowest temperatures and pressures usually produced by regional metamorphism, typically 300–450 °C (570–840 °F) and 2–10 kilobars (14,500–58,000 psi). The name comes from commonly having an abundance of green minerals such as chlorite, serpentine, and epidote, and platy minerals such as muscovite and platy serpentine. Greenstone belts are zones of variably metamorphosed mafic to ultramafic volcanic sequences with associated sedimentary rocks that occur within Archaean and Proterozoic cratons between granite and gneiss bodies.
The overlying side of a fault, Mineral Deposit or stope.
Hematite, also spelled as haematite, is the mineral form of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3), one of several iron oxides. Cratons whose ancient rocks are widely exposed at the surface, often with relatively subdued relief, are known as shields. The physicochemical phenomena and reactions caused by movement of hydrothermal water within the crust, often as a consequence of magmatic intrusion or tectonic upheavals, often resulting in the genesis of ore deposits
In place, i.e. within unbroken rock.
An “Indicated Mineral Resource” is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed (NI43-101 definition). An “Inferred Mineral Resource‟ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes.
An inlier is an area of older rocks surrounded by younger rocks.
Induced Polarisation (IP) is a technique of measuring an induced potential field in the ground in order to map the geological subsurface. From measurements of the induced potential field the chargeability and resistivity of the subsurface can be calculated. A clay mineral, part of the group of industrial minerals, with the chemical composition Al2Si2O5(OH)4.
An estimation method that minimises the estimation error between data points in determining mineral resources. Kriging is the best linear unbiased estimator of a mineral resource.
Laterite is a soil and rock type rich in iron and aluminium, and is commonly considered to have formed in hot and wet tropical areas. Nearly all laterites are of rusty-red coloration, because of high iron oxide content. They develop by intensive and long-lasting weathering of the underlying parent rock.

Mineral Reserve
Mineral Resource Mineralisation Mineralised area Ore Orogenic Gold Deposit Outcrop Plant recovery factor

Definition
Mafic is an adjective describing a silicate mineral or rock that is rich in magnesium and iron, and hence is a portmanteau of "magnesium" and "ferric". Most mafic minerals are dark in color, and common rock-forming mafic minerals include olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite. “Measured Mineral Resource‟ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity. a class of hydrothermal mineral deposits originating in the earth’s interior by deposition of a mineral mass from hot mineralised aqueous solutions, circulating at depths of approximately 1,000 m; the solutions are under great pressure and have temperatures of 300°-200°C. Mesothermal deposits form veins, sheetlike bodies, and irregularly shaped deposits.
The science of extracting metals from ores and preparing them for sale.
Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types, in a process called metamorphism, which means "change in form". The original rock (protolith) is subjected to heat (temperatures greater than 150 to 200 °C) and pressure (1500 bars), causing profound physical and/or chemical change. The comminution of the ore, although the term has come to cover the broad range of machinery inside the treatment plant where the gold is separated from the ore prior to leaching or flotation processes. The ratio of the grade of material recovered at the mill (plus residue) to the grade of ore calculated by sampling in stopes.
The MRF is equal to the mine call factor multiplied by the plant recovery factor.
That portion of a mineral resource for which extraction is technically and economically feasible.
A continuous well defined mass of material of sufficient ore content to make extraction economically feasible. A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. Adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. A Mineral Reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined. (NI43101 definition). Mineral reserves are reported as general indicators of the life of mineral deposits. Changes in reserves generally reflect:
i. development of additional reserves;
ii. depletion of existing reserves through production;
iii. actual mining experience; and
iv. price forecasts.
Grades of mineral reserve actually processed from time to time may be different from stated reserve grades because of geologic variation in different areas mined, mining dilution, losses in processing and other factors. Neither reserves nor projections of future operations should be interpreted as assurances of the economic life of mineral deposits or of the profitability of future operations. A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or natural solid fossilised organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on the Earth’s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.
The presence of a target mineral in a mass of host rock.
Any mass of host rock in which minerals of potential commercial value occur.
A mixture of valuable and worthless minerals from which at least one of the minerals can be mined and processed at an economic profit. Orogenic gold deposits dominantly form in metamorphic rocks in the mid- to shallow crust (5– 15 km depth), at or above the brittle-ductile transition, in compressional settings that facilitate transfer of hot gold-bearing fluids from deeper levels
The exposure of rock on surface.
The gold recovered after treatment processes in a metallurgical plant. It is expressed as a percentage of gold produced (in mass) over the mass of gold fed into the front of the plant (i.e. into the milling circuit).

Pyroclastic rocks or pyroclastics are clastic rocks composed solely or primarily of volcanic materials. QA/QC is the combination of quality assurance, the process or set of processes used to measure and assure the quality of a product, and quality control, the process of ensuring products and services meet predefined expectations. Reverse Circultin Drilling:- Reverse Circulation is used in drilling programmes for initial exploration and also for resource definition.
The actual grade of ore realised or produced after the mining and treatment processes.
Regolith is a layer of loose, heterogeneous superficial material covering solid rock. It includes dust, soil, broken rock, and other related materials. The process of restoring mined land to a condition approximating to a greater or lesser degree its original state. Reclamation standards are determined by the South African Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs and address ground and surface water, topsoil, final slope gradients, waste handling and re-vegetation issues. Rhyolite is a felsic extrusive rock. Due to the high silica content, rhyolite lava is very viscous. It flows slowly, like tooth paste squeezed out of a tube, and tends to pile up and form lava domes. Taking small pieces of rock at intervals along exposed mineralisation for assay (to determine the mineral content). Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized minerals or rock grains.
Saprolite is not as weathered as laterite; there is a continuum from the upper layer of saprolite to laterite. Saprolite is a chemically weathered rock (literally, it means "rotten rock").
Sediment is a naturally occurring material that is broken down by processes of weathering and erosion, and is subsequently transported by the action of wind, water, or ice, and/or by the force of gravity acting on the particles. Formed by the deposition of solid fragmental material that originates from weathering of rocks and is transported from a source to a site of deposition. A graph that describes the expected difference in value between pairs of samples as a function of sample spacing.
To become converted into or impregnated with silica.
Siliciclastic rocks (commonly misspelled siliclastic) are clastic noncarbonate sedimentary rocks that are almost exclusively silica-bearing, either as forms of quartz or other silicate minerals. All siliciclastic rocks are formed by inorganic processes, or deposited through some mechanical process, such as stream deposits (delta deposits) that are subsequently lithified. A gamma-ray spectrometric survey normally provides preliminary reconnaissance coverage of the radioelements in the topmost part of the earth's crust. Also: -Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) are 'controls' or standards used to check the quality and metrological traceability of products, to validate analytical measurement methods, or for the calibration of instruments. A certified reference material is a particular form of measurement standard. A stockwork is a complex system of structurally controlled or randomly oriented veins. Stockworks are common in many ore deposit types. A term describing the chronological sequence in which bedded rocks occur that can usually be correlated between different localities.
